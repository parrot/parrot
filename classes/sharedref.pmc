 *  Overview:
 *     The vtable functions for the SharedRef base class.
 *     This class wraps locking around PMC access.

 *     Initial revision by leo 2004.01.14
 *  Notes:
 *     All methods not present below get a default body autogenerated

 *
 *     Currently all access is locked. When we have a non-copying GC
 *     allocator we can relax that a bit.
