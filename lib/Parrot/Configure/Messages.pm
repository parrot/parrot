Hello, I'm Configure. My job is to poke and prod your system to figure out
how to build Parrot. The process is completely automated, unless you passed in
the `--ask' flag on the command line, in which case I'll prompt you for a few
pieces of info.

Since you're running this program, you obviously have Perl 5--I'll be pulling
some defaults from its configuration.

        }

        print STDERR "\nDuring configuration the following steps failed:\n";

            my $msg = sprintf "    %02d:  %s\n", (
                $fail->[0],
                $fail->[1]->{step},
            );
            print STDERR $msg;
        }
        print STDERR "You should diagnose and fix these errors before calling '$make'\n";
        return;
    }
    else {
        unless ( $args->{silent} ) {
            print <<"END";

Okay, we're done!

You can now use `$make' to build your Parrot.
After that, you can use `$make test' to run the test suite.

Happy Hacking,
