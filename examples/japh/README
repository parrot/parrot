These programs show very different ways how to print a simple
string. Some are obfuscated, some are horribly platform dependend.

To run them all (from the top level directory)

$ make
$ for f in examples/japh/japh*.pasm; do ./parrot $f ; done

These JAPHs are also tested by 'make test' in the Parrot root directory.
The test file is 't/examples/japh.t'.
