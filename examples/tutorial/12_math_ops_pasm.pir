=head1 DESCRIPTION

A tutorial lesson about Parrot's math operations (continued).

=head1 MATH OPERATIONS

Some math operations have an opcode name, but no simple operator syntax in
PIR. In these cases you can use the opcode name directly.

For a large list of the various mathematical operations supported by Parrot,
see the documentation at F<src/ops/math.ops>.

Some uncommon math operations have opcodes packaged with Parrot but not part of
core. These must be loaded as libraries. see the documentation at
F<src/dynoplibs/math.ops>, F<src/dynoplibs/obscure.ops>.

    $N0 = abs -5.0  # the absolute value of -5.0 is 5.0
    print $N0
    print "\n"

    $I1 = fact 5    # the factorial of 5 is 120
    inc $I1         # 120 incremented by 1 is 121
    print $I1
    print "\n"
