=head1 NAME

examples/tutorial/00_README.pod - A PIR tutorial.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each of the files in this directory contains valid PIR code and POD
(Perl 5's Plain Old Documentation) and can be read as plain text.
To view just the documentation without the sample code, use C<perldoc>:

 perldoc example.pir

If you'd like to execute the code from files you need to build parrot and 
then type:

 ../../parrot example.pir

The parrot test suite also checks the output of these examples, so you
always know that they are valid PIR code. You can execute all the tests
by typing:

 cd ../../ ; prove -v t/examples/tutorial.t ; cd examples/tutorial

When adding an new example or changing the output of an example please
update F<t/examples/tutorial.t> as well.
