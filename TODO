Note: To add things to the web-visible TODO list, living at
http://www.parrotcode.org/todo, send them in to
bugs-parrot@bugs6.perl.org. They then need to be tagged as todo in the
RT web interface.

Tests
-----

    Run different run cores inside Test.pm.

String subsystem
----------------

    Use string iterators where applicable.
    Implement character class & properties testing (for regular expressions)
    Automate string vtable generation
    Fill in vtables for non-ASCII encodings: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, etc.

    Find a decent way of including Unicode properties tables. (Not for
    the faint of heart.)

Vtables
-------
    PythonInteger/String/Object?

JIT
---
    More instructions needed!
    Make it work on more architectures

Configure system
----------------
    Long term, should be replaced with a bootstrapping miniparrot system.
    Short term, fix the dependencies (eg, more needs to depend on classes/*)
    Platform-independent library creation for pbc2c2.pl & extensions
    Valgrind test target on supporting platforms
    Checks for various functions and features (socket related, threads,
    sigaction ...)

Platforms
---------
    Provide own library functions e.g. snprintf for poor platforms.

IO
--
    Async IO
    Layer handling
    Full going-over to make sure it works
    Socket IO
    Docs!

Regular expression engine
-------------------------
    Implement case folding
    More speed!

Interpreter
-----------
    Combine dynamic op lib cores.
    Make the MMD tables shareable between interpreters for faster
     startup. (Though there are issues with this)
    Have exec and spawn split up their command-line arguments, rather than
     relying on the operating system shell to do this, which is unsafe

Opcodes
-------

Mark IN/OUT register usage of ops. This is mainly for stack push/pop
opcodes that have hidden semantics towards register life-time.

Assembler
---------
    Debugging and source line number info

Bytecode
--------
    Metadata (source line number info, symbol table)

pdump
-----
    Dumping constants shouldn't unpack the constants, but
    just print out the segment.

Stability
---------
    Purify, Valgrind, and other memory badness detectors

Performance
-----------
    Mo' betta benchmarks
    Add profiling build options
    Add the above to tinderbox

Documentation
-------------
    Update docs and pdds to reflect current state.
    Parrotguts currently too difficult to approach

Debugger
--------
    Add commands history and completion
    Load the commands from a file
    Make breakpoints at labels
    Read core dumps
    Attach to a running program
    List breakpoints
    Handle restart opcodes
