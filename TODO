All TODO items should be documented in RT. (http://rt.perl.org/)

A listing of all TODO items is available at:

 http://www.parrotcode.org/todo

To add TODOs to this list (which is powered by RT), send an email to 

 parrotbug@parrotcode.org

Begin your subject with '[TODO]' so that the bug is automatically marked as a
TODO ticket.  For reasons of consistency, the encouraged format of the subject
line is:

'[TODO] <subsystem/component/topic> - <summary of task>'

An example of this format would be:

'[TODO] IMCC - remove globals'
