# $Id$

=head1 Purpose

Provide a list of deprecated and experimental items in parrot.
All items in this list should have a corresponding Trac ticket[1].

=head1 Experimental Status

These features are not considered supported, even though they may
have shipped in a supported release of parrot[2]. Use them at your own
risk, as they can be removed or changed in any release. These
items are marked below with C<[experimental]>.

=head1 Deprecated Status

Please see F<docs/project/support_policy.pod> for the parrot
project's policy regarding deprecated features.

Each item shows the first release in which it is eligible for removal, e.g.
C<[eligible in 1.5]>.  If the release listed is one that has already
shipped, this feature may be removed in B<any> upcoming release, and
you should no longer rely on it.

If you find a feature you once used was removed after a deprecation
cycle, L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/Deprecation>. Otherwise
please open a documentation ticket via Trac[1].

=head1 Are you using any Deprecated Features?

When running parrot, you can receive warnings about deprecations.
Either run parrot with the C<-w> option to enable all warnings, or
deprecations specifically by including this snippet:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

 .include 'warnings.pasm'
 warningson .PARROT_WARNINGS_DEPRECATED_FLAG

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

=item GzipHandle [experimental]

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1580>

=item PackfileDebug [experimental]

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1599>

=item CodeString [eligible in 2.7]

L<http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1633>

=item multiple dispatch within core PMCs [eligible in 1.1]

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/452>

=item Method stdhandle in ParrotInterpreter [experimental]

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/264>

=item Overriding vtable invoke in PIR objects [experimental]

The VTABLE invoke in object.pmc puts SELF at the start of the
signature call arguments when there is no current object and is
not already here. This allows the usage of $P0() instead of $P0($P0).

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/103>

=item NCI without signature ("raw" pointers) [eligible in 2.4]

No equivalent functionality is promised. You shouldn't be using this. Here be
segfaults.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1549>

=item UnManagedStruct handling nested structure [eligible in 2.4]

UnManagedStruct will be simplified to only support flat structures. This means
that elements which themselves have structure - struct pointers and function
pointers will be stored as C<void *> and C<void (*)(void)> respectively. To use
these, they will need to be cast to the appropriate signature on access.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1551>

=item UnManagedStruct initializer structure [eligible in 2.4]

The initializer structure will cease to be an array of triples. In stead, an
array of flags (no counts or offsets), or a string representation of the same
information may be used.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1552>

=item UnManagedStruct get_integer, set_integer_native [eligible in 2.4]

These will no longer refer to the byte length of the buffer, but to the number
of times the struct is repeated; emulating an array of structs.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1553>

=item ManagedStruct reallocations based on shape changes [eligible in 2.4]

Since shape changes may simply be used for re-interpreting data, and may also
occur in several steps, re-allocating after any one shape change may be
undesirable. In stead, an explicit allocate/reallocate method will be provided.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1554>

=item Auto-vivification of nested aggregates [eligible in 2.4]

E.g.

  $P0 = new ['Hash']
  $S1 = $P0['foo';'bar';'baz']

will not auto-vivify nested hashes and return PMCNULL early.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1561>

=item Method lower on String [eligible in 2.7]

Use the downcase opcode or subclass with a method name consistent with your
HLL.

L<http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1606>

=item Method unescape on String [experimental]

This is a helper method for testing of Parrot_str_unescape_string.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1628>

=item logical_* vtables [eligiblie in 2.7]

These can be replaced by C<get_bool> and intval ops unless you're using them for
things that aren't really logical ops (don't do that!).

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1655>

=back

=head1 Opcodes

=over 4

=item get_addr and set_addr [eligible in 1.5]

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/218>

These opcodes are being repurposed. They will always return a unique memory
address of the PMC. Uses of get_addr and set_addr that would set label values
for Sub, Exception, and related PMC types will instead be handled by
get_label and set_label.

=item All bitwise ops [eligible in 2.1]

All bitwise ops (all ops containing C<bitwise> in their names) will be provided
by dynops.  B<NOTE>: Before removing the bitwise ops, make sure that the
equivalent dynops are available and that the major HLLs (Rakudo, Partcl, Lua,
etc) have switched to using them.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1260>

=item get_results opcode order and features [eligible in 2.1]

get_results no longer used to fetch exception object.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1406>

=item GC_SYS_NAME option to interpinfo_s_i [experimental]

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1583>

=item new_callback_p_p_p_s [eligible in 2.4]

To be replaced with new_callback_p_p_p_p_s.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1548>

=item dlfunc and new_callback signature string format [eligible in 2.4]

These will be changed to allow more flexibility in types.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1565>

=item find_lex [eligible in 2.4]

find_lex will not throw exception for non-existing lexicals.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1207>

=item inplace string updates. [eligible in 2.4]

All "inplace" string update ops are deprecated. E.g. "chopn_s", etc.
Part of COW removal.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1540>

=item find_codepoint [experimental]

Intended to replace the CodeString charname_to_ord method.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1629>

=item All opcodes that modify non-argument registers. [eligible in 2.7]

E.g. "cleari", etc.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1642>

=item exchange [eligible in 2.7]

This op is too low level for Parrot in its current form.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1643>

=item finalize [experimental]

Finalize exception handler, unrolling inner runloops if needed.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1635>

=item .meth_call [eligible in 2.7]

As of the latest PCC changes, this does nothing different from '.call'.

=item mmd_cvt_to_types [eligible in 1.1]

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/907>

=item C API coding standards cleanup [eligible in 1.1]

functions will be kept in the ticket at:

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/443>

=item PMC Attributes Allocation Functions [experimental]

 Parrot_gc_allocate_pmc_attributes
 Parrot_gc_free_pmc_attributes

These items and related helper functions are added as experimental support
for L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1506>

=item STRING Out parameters in Parrot_str_* functions [eligible in 2.1]

All STRING modification functions will return a STRING pointer; capture and use
this rather than relying on in-place modification of an existing pointer.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1584>

COW strings are to be removed. All "inplace" string modification
functions and all "inplace" string ops are deprecated.

object is supplied.

=item PCT::HLLCompiler stages [eligible in 1.1]

The interface of various methods for adding, removing, and modifying
the list stages in a PCT::HLLCompiler object is subject to change.
The existing actual stages will remain; only the mechanism for specifying
the order of individual stages is likely to change.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/462>

=item PCT::HLLCompiler from Perl 5's Test::Harness [eligible in 1.1]

In order to facilitate using PCT::HLLCompiler with test harnesses,
the C<command_line> method of PCT::HLLCompiler object exits silently
if it detects that it is being run in a sample run from Perl's
Test::Harness.  Currently this detection is done by checking the
second command line argument for "@INC"; future releases may
use a different detection mechanism or eliminate it altogether.

L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/463>

=item PAST::Val node generation [eligible in 1.5]

The PAST::Compiler may generate the code for PAST::Val nodes
(i.e., constants) at the beginning of the block (Parrot sub) instead
of the location where they occur in the PAST tree.
