=head1 Deprecation in Parrot

This is a list of currently deprecated features of Parrot.  Every deprecation
has an associated RT ticket.  Each item indicates the last release it's
guaranteed to appear in.

When deprecated items are removed, all usage of the feature in the
repository should be updated or removed; including documentation.

When deprecating opcodes, in addition to the ticket, be sure to mark the
opcode with the :deprecated flag; this will allow users to enable deprecation
warnings selectively with:

 .include 'include/warnings.pasm'
 warningson .PARROT_WARNINGS_DEPRECATED_FLAG

And then receive runtime warnings if they are using any deprecated opcodes.
The C<-w> command line option for parrot can also be used to enable all
warnings. You can use C<make warnings_tests> to run the standard test suite
with this option.

=head1 vtable entries

=item * C<new_from_string> [post 0.5.0]

See RT #47011.

=head1 Opcodes

=over 4

=item * C<store_global> [post 0.5.0]

See RT #48016. Replace usage with set_[hll,root]_global variants.

=item * C<find_global> [post 0.5.0]

See RT #48018. Replace usage with get_[hll,root]_global variants.

=item * C<get_mro> [post 0.5.0]

See RT #47976.

=item * C<n_*> math opcode variants [post 0.7.1]

See RT #58410.

=item * C<open> opcode mode string [post 0.8.2]

The C<open> opcode will change from Perl-style mode-strings to 'r' for read,
'w' for write, 'a' for append, and 'p' for pipe.

=item * C<infix> and C<n_infix> opcodes [post 0.8.2]

These opcodes were only used by the old MMD system. See TT #7.

=head1 Class Features

=over 4

=item * PMC union struct [post 0.5.0]

See RT #48014. This will be removed once all core PMCs have been updated.

=item * :anon and :vtable named parameters to add_method [post 0.8.2]

If you want to override a vtable method/function when building a Class, then
use the method C<add_vtable_override> instead of calling C<add_method> with
one or both of these flags.

=back

=head1 PIR syntax

=over 4

=item * Assignment syntax with opcodes [post 0.8.2]

See RT #36283.  When the first argument of an opcode is C<OUT>, then
the assignment syntax will be allowed, as it is today.

In any other case (i.e. C<INOUT>, C<IN>), this will become
a syntax error. For example:

    $S0 = print
    $P0 = substr 1, 2, "x"

Will have to be:

    print $S0
    substr $P0, 1, 2, "x"

=item * Exception Handlers won't automatically be disabled [post 0.8.1]

Exception handlers won't be automatically disabled after 0.8.1.
Any exception handlers that currently rely on this feature will need to
either be more specific about what they catch or rethrow exceptions they
don't recognize.

See RT #60640.

=head1 Functions

=over 4

=item Old-style MMD functions [post 0.7.1]

mmd_cvt_to_types.

See RT #60626.

=item src/pic.c and src/pic_jit.c [post 0.8.1]

These two files were a thin prototype implementation of Polymorphic Inline
Caching that only ever applied to 4 opcodes, one of which has now been removed.
The files (and all functions in them) are deprecated, and will be removed. See
RT #60048.

=item * Subs marked with C<:vtable>/C<:method> aren't in namespace [post 0.8.2]

Subs marked with C<:vtable> or C<:method> flags are no longer given a
namespace entry by default.  Use the C<:nsentry> flag to cause this
to happen.  See RT #60586 and RT #53302.

=item * Bytecode packfile segment will use subid not sub name [post 0.8.1]

See RT #60590.

=back

=head1 Compiler Tools

=over 4

=item 'get_string', 'get_bool', etc. named vtable functions [post 0.8.1]

All of the named vtable functions in PCT and PGE will lose
their names and effectively become anonymous.  See RT #60384.
