=head1 Parrot Grammar Engine (PGE)

This is an initial implementation of a regular expression/rules/grammar 
engine designed to run in Parrot.  It's definitely a work in progress, 
and much of the current implementation is designed simply to "bootstrap" 
us along (i.e., some parts such as the parser and generator are 
expected to be discarded).  The current work is also largely incomplete 
-- although it has support for groups (capturing and non-capturing), 
quantifiers, alterations, etc., many of the standard assertions and 
character classes are not implemented yet but will be coming soon.

In addition there's some experimental work here in being able to parse 
and convert Perl *5* regular expressions into PIR subroutines, but the
focus should be on building the perl6 capabilities first and we'll
fold in perl 5 syntax a bit later.

=head1 Installation

PGE assumes that it is part of the parrot distribution in the 
F<compilers/pge> directory.   Simply type C<make> in this directory
to build the F<pge.so> shared library it needs -- pge.so is
then placed in F<runtime/parrot/dynext>.  In some environments you
may need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to search this correctly.

The distribution comes with a small F<demo.pir> program that gives an
example of using PGE.  To run the demo, simply do 
C<parrot demo.pir>.  The demo understands the following commands:

    rule <pattern>    - a perl 6 rule to be matched
    text              - a text string to match against previously entered rule
    glob <pattern>    - a glob (wildcard) pattern to be matched
    print             - display the PIR cod generated for current rule
    trace             - toggle pattern execution tracing
    next              - repeat last match on target string
    
If you get errors about "cannot open shared object file", that usually
means that Parrot was unable to locate the pge.so object file.

=head1 Using PGE

Because I couldn't find a lot of detailed information about writing a
Parrot compiler in C, I went ahead and wrote this using Parrot's
native call interface.  Essentially the library provides a 
C<pge_p6rule_pir()> function that builds a PIR code string from a 
given rule string, this PIR code string can then be sent to the PIR 
compiler to get a final subroutine.  (Having the PIR code string 
easily available and printable is also very handy for debugging as 
we build the rest of the grammar engine.)

There's a PGE.pir library in F<runtime/parrot/library> that provides
PIR-compatible calling interfaces to the compiler.  Here's a short
example for compiling a regular expression and then matching it
against another string:

    load_bytecode "library/PGE.pir"          
    .local pmc p6rule_compile
    find_global p6rule_compile, "PGE", "p6rule"  # get the compiler

    .local string pattern       
    .local pmc rulesub                     
    pattern = "^(From|Subject):"           # pattern to compile
    rulesub = p6rule_compile(pattern)     # compile it to rulesub

    .local pmc match
    $S0 = "From: pmichaud@pobox.com"       # target string
    match = rulesub($S0)                   # execute rule on target string

  match_loop:
    unless match goto match_fail           # if match fails stop
    print "match succeeded\n"

    match."_print"()                       # display captures ($0, $1, etc.)

    match."_next"()                        # find the next match
    goto match_loop

  match_fail:
    print "match failed\n"            

One can also get the intermediate PIR code that PGE generates for
the rule subroutine -- just use

    (rulesub, $S0) = p6rule_compiler(target)

and you can print/inspect the contents of $S0 to see the generated code.

=head1 Known Limitations

At the moment, PGE is not very aware of Unicode strings -- it's pretty 
much limited to 8-bit Latin-1 characters in patterns.  This is because the
PGE parser is still in C, and because support for character class 
operations in Parrot is still being worked out.  Eventually these
things will be resolved and we'll fix PGE up for Unicode then.

Most of the backslash sequences (\d, \D, \N, etc.) are unimplemented, 
although backslashes do properly escape metacharacters in literals.

PGE doesn't (yet) properly handle nested repetitions of zero-length 
patterns in groups -- that's coming next.

This is just the first-cut framework for building the 
remainder of the engine, so many items (assertions, lookaround, 
conjunctions, closures, character classes, hypotheticals, 
backreferences, etc.) just aren't implemented yet.  They're
on their way!

Also, many well-known optimizations (e.g., Boyer-Moore) aren't 
implemented yet -- my primary goals at this point are to
"release early, often" and to get sufficient features in place so
that more people can be testing and building upon the engine.

Lastly, error handling needs to be improved, but this will likely
be decided as we discover how PGE integrates with the rest of
Parrot.

=head1 Implementation notes

Basically, PGE consists of a parser and a PIR code generator written
in C.  The parser takes a string representing a P6 rule and builds a
parse tree for the rule.  The generator then produces a PIR subroutine
(matching engine) that can match strings according to the components 
of the rule.

The matching engine uses bsr/ret for its internal subroutine calls 
(also optimized for tailcalls) and then uses Parrot calling 
conventions for all interfaces with external callers/callees.  
The compiler is designed such that we can switch the matching engine 
to use PCC for its internal calls at some point in the future.

PGE also uses Parrot coroutines for the matching
engine, so that after a successful match is found, the 
next match within the same string can be found by simply 
returning control to the matching coroutine (which then
picks up from where it had previously left off until
another match is discovered).
