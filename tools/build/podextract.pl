=head1 DESCRIPTION

Simple POD Extraction

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Previously:

    perldoc -ud $target $source

or

    perldoc -u $source > $target

Now:

    perl podextract.pl $source $target

=head1 RATIONALE

C<perldoc> does many things, and is somewhat complex.

For instance, normally,

    perldoc perldoc

Inspects various paths, and paths that are controlled by C<%ENV> to find relevant documentation for "perldoc".

And because of this, it is a little security concious, and pre-emptively drops root to UID=nobody

But Parrot is not using this feature of C<perldoc>

Parrot is simply using C<perldoc> as a content filter to extract C<POD> from source files.

And as such, it only needs the alternative function

    perldoc $PATH

To work, which doesn't require C<%ENV>, and additionally, dropping root to C<UID=nobody> makes it impossible
for some parrot to invoke C<perldoc -ud $target $source> on some systems, because it drops privelages and can then no longer read C<$source>, and can no longer write C<$target>.

However, some means vendor tooling that B<MUST> execute C<make install> as root, by proxy, C<MUST> invoke C<perldoc> as root, and as such, invokes the security problem, which is impossible to work around.

Given a simple C<chmod> is not enough, because parent directories also are not readable or writeable by C<UID=nobody>, and additionally, vendor tooling causes fatal access violations when a process running as C<UID=nobody> even attempts to do directory lookaround ( which C<perldoc> does much of as part of C<%ENV> handling )

So this tool is simple:

It takes the very core utility in C<PerlDoc> that parrot needed to utilize, and calls it directly.

And this avoids the misguided attempts of increasing security, which simply does nothing useful.
