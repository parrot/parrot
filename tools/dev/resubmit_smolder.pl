=head1 SYNOPSIS

    perl tools/dev/resubmit_smolder.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is a simple wrapper around the Parrot::Harness::Smoke functions
needed to resubmit a smoke test tarball to our Smolder server if the initial
transmission of that tarball failed.

The command should be run from the top-level of your checkout of Parrot.  It
will fail if no file named F<parrot_test_run.tar.gz> exists in that directory.
