On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot @release.version@, also known
as \"@release.name@\".  Parrot (@web.root@) is a virtual machine aimed
at running all dynamic languages.

Parrot @release.version@ is available on Parrot's FTP site
(@ftp.path@), or by following the
download instructions at @web.root@@web.source@.  For those who would like
to develop on Parrot, or help develop Parrot itself, we recommend using Git to
retrieve the source code to get the latest and best Parrot code.

Parrot @release.version@ News:
@NEWS@

The SHA256 message digests for the downloadable tarballs are:
@add corresponding lines@

Many thanks to all our contributors for making this possible, and our sponsors
for supporting this project.  Our next scheduled release is @release.nextdate@.

Enjoy!

To clone the Parrot Git repo into a directory called 'parrot', use the following:

If you want it to be in a directory other than 'parrot', then just give that as a second
argument to clone:

Bug Day

On @bugday.day@, @bugday.date@, please join us on IRC in #parrot
(irc.parrot.org) to work on closing out as many Trac tickets
(https://trac.parrot.org) tickets as possible in the parrot queue. This will
help us get ready for the next release of parrot: @release.version@, scheduled
for @release.day@, @release.date@. You'll find C, parrot assembly, perl,
documentation, and plenty of tasks to go around. Core developers will be
available most of the day (starting at around 10am GMT) to answer questions.

No experience with parrot necessary.

--From: @wiki.root@@wiki.bugday@--

Check the list at:

https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/report/3

Which contains all the tickets I'd like to see resolved in @release.version@. To
see all the open tickets, use:

https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/report

If you've got something you're working on that you think you'll be
getting done before the release, please
- add a ticket for it (if necessary);
- set its milestone to this release.

Thanks in advance for your patches and commits. ^_^

... Speaking of patches, we should also get through as many of these
(accept or reject) as possible.
