DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is an Ook! compiler written in Parrot assembly, version 0.1.0

This is a compiler and not an interpreter. This means that the code
is read, then compiled into Parrot assembly (yes, the target language
is also Parrot). Then you can fetch the Parrot assembly generated,
assemble it and interpret it with Parrot just as you would with any
other Parrot assembly file.

You should compile and test the files with (this will run a hello
world program):

     $ make test

Then you can compile your Ook! program with: 

     $ ../../parrot ook.pbc program.ook


FILES
-----
The files are the following:
        ook.pasm        well, that's pretty much the whole stuff
        hello.ook       a ook script that greets the world!


TODO
----
* implement the "Ook. Ook!" instruction
