Revision history for a Ook! compiler written in Parrot and targeting Parrot.

0.2.0 Tue Apr  5 20:35:49 CEST 2005
        - fixed register usage to leave bottom half of register (0->15)
          for parrot internal use.
        - make test no longer core dumps.

0.1.0 Thu Feb 19 21:31:28 CET 2004
        - use of eval to avoid temp file (courtesy of Leopold Toetsch)
        - updated (after 1 year...) the README to reflect this use of eval

0.0.2 Tue Dec 31 18:02:01 CET 2002
        - Nicholas Clark reported a bug when there's a complex nesting
          of while instructions in the ook source. This version fixes
          it with a brand new scheme of naming the labels in the
          generated Parrot assembly.
        - added a test.ook file that illustrates the old bug, and
          works as Test::Harness expects.

0.0.1 Mon Dec 30 23:46:32 CET 2002
        - thanks to a silly idea of Nicholas Clark, first draft of this
          Ook! compiler written in Parrot.
	- every Ook! instruction is implemented but the "Ook. Ook!"
          one.
        - currently spitting Parrot assembly on stdout.
