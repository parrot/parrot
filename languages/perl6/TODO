A short-term list of todo items:

- Update and revise documentation.

- Move tests to match planned hierarchy.
  http://p6stories.kwiki.org/index.cgi?ProposedTestHierarchy

- Switch to using real parrot lexical and global variables.

- Update calling conventions to match Melvin's IMCC simplifications
  (.sub instead of .pcc_sub, etc).

- Update operators to match current set in p6 design.

- Re-implement exceptions using Parrot exceptions.

- Move builtin functions to separate modules written in Perl 6 code.
  (In the process: implement module loading, implement features
  necessary to make functions work, etc.)

- Hard-coded lists of operators are kept in P6C/Parser.pm,
  P6C/AddContext.pm, P6C/IMCC/Binop.pm, P6C/IMCC.pm (P6C::Binop),
  P6C/IMCC/hype.pm. Contain this morass, preferably with a single list
  maintained in a single location.

- Change P6C::Tree::String's concat_list function so it doesn't insert
  a literal "~" operator (was a literal "_" operator).

- Move P6C::Binop (etc) out of IMCC.pm and into their own files,
  possibly distribute the code between P6C::Node::* and P6C::IMCC::*.

- Add tests for operator precedence (noticed some problems with bitwise ops).

- Make vector operators (P6C::IMCC::hype.pm) use the standard binary
  and unary operator implementations, instead of re-implementing every
  one in hype.pm.
