urmc - an URM compiler for Parrot

2003 (c) by Marcus Thiesen <marcus@cpan.org>

What is URM?
============

URM is a "language" at least used in German universities to teach the
basic principles of programming. URM stands for Universal Register
Machine - it basically means that you have a couple of operations and
an unlimited amount of registers to use for your programs.
See Syntax for a description

Why a compiler?
===============

You might know that it is quite boring to program with pen and paper,
at least if you're not debugging some screwed up C code but just some
examples for your upcoming exam. So, I didn't want to learn and I
wrote a compiler - in Perl. It wasn't really a compiler, just some
regexes and eval commands. It had one problem - it was slow.

So I dropped it and didn't think about it for a year now. Enter
Acme. He gave quite a good talk on YAPC::EU 2003 about "Little
languages in Parrot" and I dreamt of rewriting my URM compiler to run
on Parrot. So here it is! :-)

Usage
=====

The urm compiler (urmc) has some command line arguments and operation modes.
One is to simply call it with 
	./urmc somefile.urm
and it will compile it to a temporary pasm (Parrot Assembly) file and
try to execute this file with your Parrot installation.

The other one mode is if you call it with
	./urmc -c somefile.urm
it will create a pasm file called somefile.pasm which you can execute
by hand with your parrot installation.
The URM standard is rather strict (see Syntax) and therefore does not
allow some operation which are easy to implement (e.g. writing r1 <-
r2 + 1). I allowed these options but throw a warning every time you
violate the standard. If you don't like these warnings you can say
	./urmc -s somefile.urm 
which will not give any warnings.


Overall Syntax
==============

URM is rather simple - if you're an assembler programmer :-)

At the beginning of each file you got to have two lines, defining the
input and output registers of your program:
	in (r1,r2)
	out (r3)
You can have as many input registers as you like (delimited by ",")
but only one output register.

Code lines are always preceded by their logical line number (not the
actual line number in the file) which are addressed in the goto
control flow statements.

Register Naming
===============
Registers hold ints, i.e. one plain decimal number

Registers are always named with a beginning r followed by a
digit to identify it:
	r1
	r537
	r249343

Branching
==========
The URM knows two operations to modify the program flow.
The unconditioned branching is a simple goto followed by a logical
line number:
	goto 5
	goto 72

To get a conditioned branch you can only test if a register is 0:
	if r3 = 0 goto 37
	if r5 = 0 goto 1

These are the only control flow commands.

Operations
==========
The URM knows three operations:
1. Initialize a register with zero:
	r3 <- 0
This is believed to be optional, therefore it is only for good style
in my examples.
(Really, we were told that the registers are believed to be in a state
of 0, but we had to initialize them)

2. Add 1 to a register
To add a number to a register you can execute
	r4 <- r4 + 1
Note: The register number before and after the <- must match, you can
not directly add one register to another.

Note: You can only add 1 to a register.

3. Subtract 1 from a register
Guess what:
	r4 <- r4 - 1
Note: The same rules as for adding, only operate on one register and
only subtract 1.

Program End
===========
To end a program, you have to jump to a nonexistent line behind the
end of the code. If your code has e.g. 14 logical lines a 
	goto 15
will end the program and output the value of the output register.

See the files in the examples/ directory for some examples.

Last Notes
==========

The compiler is written in Perl and uses only basic features of this
language, so it shouldn't have such a huge version requirement.

Prerequisites
=============
Getopt::Long is needed for urmc
Parrot to actually execute the code.

License
=======
This stuff is all GPL, see LICENSE

Debugging
=========
I included my original URM compiler as urm-old.pl. As it is very slow
I don't recommend using it, but it outputs the whole program flow to
STDOUT. Maybe you can use it as a debugging help.

Have fun
	Marcus

P.S.: 
It took me about 20 minutes in that exam to figure out how to get a
sum from 1 to n-1 over n right in URM. Try it yourself.
