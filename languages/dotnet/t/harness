=head1 NAME

languages/dotnet/t/harness - A harness for .Net

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    cd languages && perl -Idotnet/t dotnet/t/harness --files

    cd languages && perl -Idotnet/t dotnet/t/harness

    cd languages/dotnet && perl -It t/harness

    cd languages/dotnet && perl -It t/harness t/examples.t

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If I'm called with a single
argument of "--files", I just return a list of files to process.
This list is one per line, and is relative to the languages dir.

If I'm called with no args, I run the complete suite.

Otherwise I run the tests that were passed on the command line.

    # Someone specified tests for me to run.
    @files = map { glob( $_ ) } @ARGV

    # I must be running out of languages/$language
    # You may want a deeper search than this.
    @files = glob( File::Spec->catfile( 't', '*.t' ) );
