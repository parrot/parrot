=head1 NAME

languages/befunge/t/harness - A harness for befunge

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  cd languages && perl -I../lib befunge/t/harness --files

  cd languages && perl -I../lib befunge/t/harness 

  cd languages && perl -I../lib befunge/t/harness \
                   befunge/t/basic.t

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If I'm called with a single
argument of "--files", I just return a list of files to process.
This list is one per line, and is relative to the languages dir.

If I'm called with no args, I run the complete suite.

Otherwise I run the tests that were passed on the command line.
