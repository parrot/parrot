Current status:

Only a shell of a language at this point.

Things that work:

- String parsing.
- 2 operators.

Things to do:

- eliminate use of PGE::OpTable; APL doesn't have operator precedence, so
  this is kind overkill. We can specify everything in the grammar itself.

- Add framework to allow non-opcode operators - for example, Circular doesn't
  map directly to parrot opcodes, but requires a translation:
  
  1 CIRCLE 2 ===> sin 2

  as opposed to

  1 PLUS 2 ==> add 1, 2

  We can map the arguments of the plus directly to an opcode, but circle
  requires more work - there are other operators/functions that will require 
  the ability to call a generic sub or method.

- TGE is slow. At least part of this is due to inability to precompile.
  on Allison's list of things to do.

- Need more tests! Add more tests to t/dyadic.t. Int * Float is alright, but
  need Int * Int and Float * Float.

- Add variable assignment.

- Remove the punie remnant of 'print' - in APL, the default is to print if 
  The leftmost item wasn't assignment.

- Any skipped tests. (Which are skipped instead of TODO'd only because of
  the current speed of APL)

- Add function declarations.

- Add vectors (May involve re-doing how we handle strings, as from APL's
  point of views, strings are just vectors of characters)

- Allow exponents in numeric constants

- Fix float rendering (no extra zeros!)

- Add DOMAIN ERROR exceptions when trying to use certain operators on
  strings
