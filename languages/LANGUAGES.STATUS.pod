=head2 Jako

=over 4

=item Author

Gregor Purdy

=item Description

C/Perl like language, first compiler for Parrot. The intent is to have a block-structured
language that is higher level than IMC, but still exposes the underlying virtual machine
rather directly, in the hope that this will eventually be useful for coding extensions to
the VM in a language more natural than IMC.

See also L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jako_(programming)>.

=item Status

The compiler Works, and the language and examples include subroutines and global
constants and variables. NCI also works.
The Jako examples are tested during smoke testing.
The 'queens' example currently has problems and is therefore not tested.

Has a low-tech hand-coded lexer and parser, and the ability to spit out the parse
tree as XML for debugging. Syntax is a bit rigid, but includes forms that will
be familiar to Perl programmers.
