=head1 OVERVIEW

This was originally written as a perl5 script. Rather than doing bootstrapping,
I foolishly decided it would be fun to write the parser IN parrot assembly,
esp. as this would help implementing "eval" and "proc" (Of course, in
retrospect, I really wish I had kept with the bootstrapping effort, as I think
it would have generated usable results sooner. Ah well, I now know more than
I want to about IMCC. =-)

This is a from-scratch implementation, based only on the tcl man page(s).
Another interesting project would have been to modify the tcl source and 
have it generate parrot directly. Many people smarter than I am have
declared this I<hard>, so I'm rather happy I'm working on it this way.  

(Apparently Tcl's bytecode engine is very optimized for Tcl (big surprise).
So, converting the tcl-specific bytecodes there to parrot would apparently
be a big deal.)

=head1 RUNNING TCL

When you make tcl, you're generating three files. 

=over 4

=item lib/tclword.pbc

This is a parrot class that is used by the parser as the intermediate
representation after parsing. So, for example, a line like

 set a "$b " 

would, after parsing, be comprised of three tclwords. The first, the
constant C<set>, the second, the constant C<a>, and the third would
consist of two elements: the variable reference for C<b>, followed
by the constant C< >.

=item lib/tcllib.pbc

This file is used to load all the various commands, ops, etc. into
the appropriate namespaces, as well as declare and register the TCL
compiler for the C<compile> opcode.

This file is actually built in two steps. The first step uses C<tcl.pl>
to generate C<lib/tcllib.imc>, using C<tcl.imc_template> as a template.
The file is basically passed through unchanged, except for a few <C${ }>
-style substitutions. C<INCLUDES> make sure all the required C<.imc> files
are included properly. It adds a C<HEADER>, and removes any C<XXX> comments.

=item tcl.pbc

This is roughly equivalent to C<tclsh> - It takes the command line arguments
(currently, the name of the file you wish to parse), and reads in the file,
and uses the tcl library to parse those contents as tcl.

=head1 TESTS

To run the test suite, C<make test>. If you want to also get output from the
TODO tests, C<make devtest> instead. This is NOT the tcl test suite, it's
a very small subset of features that I was sick of fixing everytime I made
a small change to the parser.

=head1 EXAMPLES

There are examples in the C<examples> directory that are vaguely more
interesting. To run one of the C<foo.tcl> files in that directory, type
C<make foo>.
