=head1 ParTcl

A from scratch implementation of Tcl on Parrot.

To build the tcl interpreter, first build the required dynamic pmcs:
From the top level parrot directory, run: C<(cd dynpmcs && make)>

Then, type C<make> in this directory. This will
generate the file C<tcl.pbc> which can then be used to run tcl programs.

I<Note - due to a bug in the current parrot implementation, you must be
in the root development directory.>

 ./parrot languages/tcl/tcl.pbc foo.tcl

=head2 Examples

To run an example, change to the C<examples>, and type C<make>
for instructions

=head2 Test Suite

To run the test suite, type "make test". Note - if I<any> tests fail, try
setting the environment variable C<TEST_PROG_ARGS> to C<-G> and retry.

If the tests now pass, there's a GC bug that needs to be reported to
the perl6-internals list.
