=head1 Primary Goal

Primary goal right now should be to pass a single test from a single file in
the tcl suite of tests.

Let's pick C<concat.test>, as we already would pass several of those tests
if they were recast into the tcl test suite.

To get this to work, we need to get (at least partial) implementations of:

  [lsearch]
  [namespace children]
  [namespace import -force]
  [package require]

the test scripts import the library C<tcltest>, which in turn uses quite
a bit more. We can use a stripped down version of C<tcltest> that does
the bare minimum to get things started.

=item interactive tclsh

simple interactive mode now exists. Still have to:

 o Should catch any real_exceptions thrown.
 o respect tcl_prompt1, tcl_prompt2
 o deal with incomplete input (needs better error handling)
 o give invalid commands to the system.

=item [interpinfo name]

how to do this from inside parrot?
[ there's a RT ticket for this now, someone should put the # here.]

=item migrate all these issues to RT.

TODO tests would also suffice, where possible -- For those of you
who know tcl, this would be a great place to contribute code - tests
based on the latest Tcl man pages will B<really> help.

=item List to String

The current list to string logic in C<dynclasses/tcllist.pmc> is missing logic
to properly escape string elements. 

[list a\[ b\]] should generate {a\[} b\\] (note the difference in handling of [ and ] !)

"\n" should be escaped as \n. "\t" as \t, etc. \, $, ; should be back-
whacked to \\, \$, \;

=item string to list 

Should be moved to tcllist's set_string method. ... except that it turns
out this is non-trivial.

=item Use PMCs to handle numifying

not the pir routines we now have. Verify that [expr 2a + 2b] behaves
appropriately when doing this. Include proper numification of octal and
hex.

=item clean up variable access

Currently wherever a normal C<find_lex> or C<store_lex>  might be, we have a 
snippet of code
to lookup the call_level (shouldn't even have this as a global), and based on
that, treat the variable like a global instead. This should all be re-factored
out into a single location. We also hardcode the default global namespace, 
which in parrot is "Tcl". Refactoring this will save us pain when we add
[namespace] support.

=item implement default globals, etc.

=item Remove Perl*

Mostly done. All that seems to be left is PerlUndef. Much was already
converted to the internal types. PerlUndef removal will probably result
(finally) in the use of null checks where it's being used for that, and
TclObject where it's being used for shimmering.

Left in:

./lib/commands/inline.imc
./lib/commands/open.imc
./lib/commands/source.imc
./lib/expression.imc
./lib/get_var.imc
./lib/tclword.imc

=item provide a way to access existing library PIR from Tcl.

Perhaps via C<namespace import>

=item multiple level lists

=item compiler vs. interpreter

it should be possible to further extend our interpreter
this to make an actual compiler, where the compiler emits PIR. 

And once we have the pir_code, we can either emit the necessary
PIR (ala parrot's -o option) or we can compile and run it.

Caveat: how to support -o with user defined procs - right now, proc is defining
the sub on the fly, where, with a compiler, we may want to defer compilation,
and simply be able to extract the generated PIR.

=item expr

Clean up [expr]. MUUUUCH room for improvement there. [expr] is the source
of most of our abysmal performance in bench.tcl.

the expr AST could use a rework. Be nice if it just passed around something
invokable.

clean up expr so that it's not passing around
type indicators. - just use PMCs everywhere. (Though we may still need
to have CONST vs. VARIABLE types.)

The type indicator is also used to disambiguate operators and function calls
from operands. We can easily remove it for operands, but how to cleanly
remove this for operators? 

TBD: strings, floats as operands - (many of the math funcs return floats
but you can't specify them, and not everything takes them 
(try, for example, [expr sin(1) + sin(1)] vs [expr sin(1) * sin(1)].)

TBD: blocks, commands, and strings as operands

TBD: logical binary ops & ternary op (need deferred evaluation) ; unary ops;
ops that work on strings only.

TBD: functions that take > 1 arg.

TBD: Argument type requirements - Currently works ONLY on bitand - esp need
to get any that require int-only args, as we can now /generate/ floats,
even if we cannot specify them. This is all supportable by MMD - we just
need to specify the correct errors to throw.
