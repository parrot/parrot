=item release

OK AFTER HERE - ONCE DONE HERE, then update config.in for our Main Makefile -
delete any crufty files. Do a fresh checkout from CVS - overrwrite all my changes
in languages/tcl - make sure a fresh build works, following the CVS directions I
provide for Leo.... then ship it to Leo for publication to the list.
Put in a version number. put in a CHANGELOG.
Thank wossisname for the maintenance path, encourage other patches?


=item unfinished commands

array, error, and catch are currently not finished, though preliminary 
subs exist for them.

=item expr

TBD: octal, hex. (there's no way to convert go programmatically from an
octal or hex string in parrot to a int?)

TBD: strings, floats as operaands - (many of the math funcs return floats
but you can't specify them, and not everything takes them 
(try, for example, [expr sin(1) + sin(1)] vs [expr sin(1) * sin(1)].)

TBD: blocks, commands, and strings as operands

TBD: logical binary ops & ternary op (need deferred evaluation) ; unary ops;
ops that work on strings only.

TBD: functions that take > 1 arg.

TBD: Argument type requirements - Currently works ONLY on bitand - esp need
to get any that require int-only args, as we can now /generate/ floats,
even if we cannot specify them.

=item release

still missing a few files from the manifest/makefile.in (all the ops,
the functions, check the new commands)

=item release

Cut a new release for Leo to add to the repo.

=item misc

tclsh normally does some extra processing that we aren't doing, namely
.tclshrc/tclshrc.tcl, setting of variables argc, argv, argv0, and
tcl_interactive... see also "man n tclvars"

=item misc

interactive tclsh mode currently only waits for EOF and then runs all
commands entered. should have sane defaults for tcl_prompt1, tcl_prompt2
and respect them, and process intermediate input.

=item misc

use shebang magic in the examples to make them directly runnable.
(see power.tcl for an example - this really should be done in the same
way the generated makefiles are)

=item misc

octal, hex, and unicode escapes are not supported. (Not sure parrot is
ready for this yet)

=item speed

fact.tcl is currently about 8-12x slower with us than than tclsh on OS X.

=item tests 

run a tcl test suite and pass one test.

=item parrot

Parrot exception handlers are currently fubar and can't be enabled.
 so referencing an unknown
tcl variable will cause a parrot error. (this is quite bad, but won't
be terrible until catch gets implemented)

=item parrot

array variables - we're very close to supporting them, but the inability
to trap exceptions in parrot is stopping us from cleaning things up.

=item proc

doesn't handle varargs. (needs [list])

throw a tcl error if the user-defined proc is called with the wrong # args

=item misc

(aside - expression needs better error handling support, and perhaps
a rethunk on how we're passing data around - FYI, if we're going to be using
PerlInt, PerlNum, etc, we need to make sure they stringify as tcl
expects them to - a PerlNum of 5 -> "5" instead of "5.0", e.g.)

With this, write error. (which needs global vars first)

Then make sure that if the script ends with a non TCL_OK status, that 
the return value that percolated up is printed out.

If the return type of the outermost script is not OK, return the
appropriate code to the system.

Then write catch.

Then think about stacktraces.

=item cleanup
 
Fix the makefiles in examples/ and t/ so that they are nicely generated like
the primary makefile.

=item misc

list variables - stringToList already exists (had to write it for "proc"s
argument handling.) - need to write listToString, need to be able to save
Lists as variables. 

(That last comment seems to assume that I'm not going to want to pass
around just strings, but instead have real variables types: a laudable but
currently undone goal. For example, we could do the following:

	arrays  - PerlHash
	lists   - PerlArray
	strings - PerlString
	ints    - PerlInt
        floats  - PerlNum

right now, anything in an expression is done as a parrot int, and anything
returned from command is a parrot string. Should start passing around a 
pmc as the value for both of these, and have anything that needs to 
perate on a value be smart enough to know how to convert it to the 
appropriate type.  Expressions are a bit harder because we need an additional
bit of information. (is this an op, an operand, or "a chunk that is yet to
be evaluated)

=item missing procs

Here's a list of commands from the 7.3 Ousterhout book that have yet to be
implemented. Just because something is implemented doesn't mean it's a full
implementation, either. That's what the test suite is for. =-) I've tried
to group them so that any procs that depend on another proc to really work
are so listed, and that related procs are grouped together. Some are SMOPs
at this point, others require me to add features, or refactor. Many already
implemented procs will require updating after procs/features are added.

  catch, error 

  upvar, uplevel, global - should be pretty easy with the lexical pad
      support in parrot.

  foreach  {list}

  switch  {regexp regsub glob}

  array (lib/commands/array.imc exists, haven't touched it recently)

  list {concat, llength, linsert, lreplace, lrange, lappend,
          lsearch, lsort, split, join}

  cd, file, pwd, pid, glob

  seek, tell, open, close, eof, flush, read, gets

  open close (puts channelid)

  string

  scan {list}

  info, exec

  auto_mkindex*, trace*

  unknown, history [ only in interactive mode ]

  regexp, regsub
 
  unset   (How do you remove a variable from the lexical scope ? - )

  * isn't a recent distro of tcl
  
  And, here are more from a more recent tcl in no order.

  after bgerror binary case clock dde
  encoding fblocked fconfigure fcopy fileevent filename
  http interp library
  lindex load lset memory
  msgcat namespace package packagens
  pkgMkIndex re_syntax registry resource
  safe socket subst tcltest
  tclvars update variable vwait

=item tests

Long term goal: Run the tcl test suite. Will an  older one, be easier to pass?

The sooner we can do this, the better, as I only want to have tests for
internals, not for any Tcl.

=item misc

Think about making "debug" something that's handled by C<tcl.pl> instead
of in PIR.. It can't be good to have all those branches.

=item parrot

Get imcc to complain if you call a macro without passing all the arguments.

=item parrot

Get imcc to NOT require a useless label when using the calling conventions:

This is pretty much a dead issue since we hardly use the .pcc_call style
anymore. (yay, Melvin!) There are two cases where we MUST use it, in
interpret when we call the appropriate command sub or op sub.

=item misc

Optimizations... I'm primarily concerned about functionality at this point,
and have probably got some brain dead stuff that can be optimized now.
