=item *

Fix the makefiles in examples/ and t/ so that they are nicely generated like
the primary makefile.

=item *

scalar variables - (new_pad, find_lex, store_lex) - for global (tcl, not imc) variables, we only need one pad for now. I think. need to know how static depth pads interacted with the #@#$ stack.

=item *

return, stacktraces, errors...

=item *

array variables (this is going to require writing PMCs, I think.)

=item *

list variables (non fast, we can just use strings. A real implmementation will
use an array type PMC under the hood, I think.)

Here's a list of commands from the 7.3 Ousterhout book that have yet to be
implemented. Just because something is implemented doesn't mean it's a full
implementation, either. That's what the test suite is for. =-) I've tried
to group them so that any procs that depend on another proc to really work
are so listed, and that related procs are grouped together. Some are SMOPs
at this point, others require me to add features, or refactor. Many will
require updating after features are added - "unset", for example, will need
to be fixed when arrays are supported.

a partial version of "expr" and "proc" must happen RSN.

  eval source
  unset
  array 
  proc -> upvar uplevel global trace
  expr -> if while for foreach
  list -> concat llength linsert lreplace lrange lappend
          lsearch lsort split join
  regexp regsub -> switch
  cd file glob pwd pid
  seek tell open close eof flush read gets
  format string scan
  catch error return break continue
  info time trace* exec
  auto_mkindex*
  unknown history

  * isn't a recent distro of tcl

  And, here are more from a more recent tcl in no order.

  after bgerror binary case clock dde
  encoding fblocked fconfigure fcopy fileevent filename
  http interp library
  lindex load lset memory
  msgcat namespace package packagens
  pkgMkIndex re_syntax registry resource
  safe socket subst tcltest
  tclvars update variable vwait

=item *

Long term goal: Run the tcl test suite. Preferably an older one, it'll probably be easier to pass. (I wonder how much of the test suite is tied up to the implementation - I'm ok with failing tests that suck. =-)

=item *

Get imcc to report on where the error is pre-macro expansion.
(if you introduce an error into the is_space macro, for example,
 the error is reported in a completely
different location -  presumably the error checking occurs post macro-subst.)

=item *

Get imcc to complain if you call a macro without passing all the arguments.

=item *

Get imcc to complain if you try to define the same .local symbol twice.

=item *

Optimizations... I'm primarily concerned about functionality at this point,
and have probably got some brain dead stuff that can be optimized now. There are
more clever things, like keeping track of where a [ ] pair is - I have to find
it twice (once for determining where the word ends, once for finding it so I 
can execute it.) Could save a bit of time, I'm sure, if someone clued up the
parser.
