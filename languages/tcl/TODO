=item Makefile deps

Should be more explicit about the PMC dependencies in the makefile. *something*
is causing things to get rebuilt unecessarily each time "make tclsh" is run.

=item keyed access

tcl is not using Keys when getting from aggregates. It probably should,
at least for language interoperability.

=item interactive tclsh

 o catch any real_exceptions thrown.
 o respect tcl_prompt1, tcl_prompt2
 o deal with incomplete input (needs better error handling)
 o add back in support for dispatch to shell.

=item implement default globals, etc.

global variables provided by tcl libary. L<tclvars>.

global variables provided by tcl interpreter. L<tclsh>

source per-user settings. L<tclsh>

=item provide a way to access existing library PIR from Tcl.

Perhaps via [namespace import]? Can fake it right now with [inline]

=item [expr] mdiep is currently working on this.

Clean up [expr]. MUUUUCH room for improvement there. [expr] is the source
of most of our abysmal performance in bench.tcl.

the expr AST could use a rework. Be nice if it just passed around something
invokable.

clean up expr so that it's not passing around
type indicators. - just use PMCs everywhere. (Though we may still need
to have CONST vs. VARIABLE types.)

The type indicator is also used to disambiguate operators and function calls
from operands. We can easily remove it for operands, but how to cleanly
remove this for operators?

TBD: blocks and strings as operands

TBD: logical binary ops & ternary op (need deferred evaluation) ; unary ops;
ops that work on strings only.

TBD: functions that take > 1 arg.

TBD: Argument type requirements - Currently works ONLY on bitand - esp need
to get any that require int-only args, as we can now /generate/ floats,
even if we cannot specify them. This is all supportable by MMD - we just
need to specify the correct errors to throw.

=over 4

=item [pwd]

Need to open an RT ticket on this.

=item [interpinfo name] [#36277]

how to do this from inside parrot? Design issue: what's the right
answer? if we're called as C<parrot tcl.pbc foo.tcl>, do we report just
C<parrot>, or C<parrot tcl.pbc> ?

=item [split]

There's already a split opcode that should do most of what we need, except
it's not quite finished yet.

=item [after], [vwait]

pending the event system thunk.
