If there's no measurable benefit (e.g. being able to build on a new compiler) to a change, there's not much point.  From the log of #parrot, the benefit appears to be the possibility of additional instrumentation in a debug build.  I don't find this especially compelling.

This is indeed something we need to fix.\n\u003ctt\u003eack -a '\\(\\s*INTVAL\\s*\\)'|wc -l\u003c/tt\u003e currently returns 241 after make realclean and isn't guaranteed to be exhaustive in catching misuses.  This raises two questions.  The first is how we know when to close this ticket.  There are legitimate uses for INTVAL casts and we want to make sure that those don't prevent this ticket from being closed.  A manual review is probably the best option.  The second issue is making sure that this problem doesn't appear again.  Unless someone wants to write a codingstd test that parses C well enough to detect this, vigilance is the best way to keep it out.\n\u003c/p\u003e","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"aeaa659130ab92a2084a11638a6eb1a6beb03360"},"timestamp":1291648085,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDMxMTI=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/432#issuecomment-3503112"},"message":"\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ca class=\"new ticket\" href=\"http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1046\" title=\"bug: Configure.pl allows sizeof(INTVAL) != sizeof(void *), but parrot requires ...
