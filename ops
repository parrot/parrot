Neither does nqp-setting. Attempting to use both libraries in the same project (which is very possible if using distutils from an NQP-rx script) causes naming conflicts. Specifically, the problem I am having is that distutils is attempting to call the \"slurp\" method from osutils, but is going to the \"slurp\" method in nqp-setting instead. The one in nqp-setting has different semantics and doesn't allow you to specify the encoding.\n\nI would like to add proper namespacing to osutils, but that's going to require some changes to distutils and maybe other languages. I don't know how well-used that library is. Another alternative would be to add NQP setting functions to a namespace (\"NQP::Setting\"?). I don't know how well that change would be received either.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2012","files":null}]}
