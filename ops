I'd build with CMUCL if it were packaged for my platform (unfortunately not). I have SBCL and CLISP, how much work would I have to do to get either of those to work?\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nI'm not sure; it's probably not trivial, but may not be all that hard.  I gave up on SBCL compatibility when I realized that using certain CMUCL internals would speed development of the cross-compiler, and didn't bother to look for the SBCL equivalents.  In order to run the compiler natively, I had to get rid of those nonportable hacks, but I'm pretty sure that others have crept in during the meantime.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"citation\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n I can also help with a configure system if you are interested.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"citation\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n I will, if I can get it to work again.  Kea-CL has been dormant for over two years now, largely because I can't keep up.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n I'll try to lend a hand to get you up to speed. Hopefully that helps a bit.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThank you for your kind offers, but I'm still trying to decide whether or not I want to put the effort into keeping Kea-CL going.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"citation\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n I stand corrected. Parrot does search in $CWD (indirectly, by just giving up and trying the path unmodified). However, due to the previously mentioned bug in ops2c, there is no way to have a dynoplib under a relative path (they must be in the root of one of the dynext search paths). Also, through a quirk of dlopen, paths that don't contain a slash get interpreted specially, so dumping the dynoplib directly in $CWD will not work either.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nAh, I wondered why that didn't work.  Mystery solved.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"citation\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n My recommendation, short term would be to either add to the dynext search path (for example, by using the -X option), or to use one of the existing, working search paths (eg: $CWD/dynext).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nI think I'll do the former, since that is more than adequate for running my test suite.
