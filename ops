The\ncontents of the aggregate, rather than the aggregate itself, will be passed.\n\nIf the C\u003cNAMED\u003e bit is also set, the aggregate will be used as a hash; its\ncontents, as key/value pairs, will be passed as named parameters. The PMC\nmust implement the full hash interface. {{ TODO: Limit the required\ninterface. }}\n\nWhat is the required interface? How should it be limited? This, I\nsuspect, needs to be discussed and decided upon, and then documented\nin the PDD.\n```\n\nOriginally reported in http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=45367\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1288","files":null}]}
