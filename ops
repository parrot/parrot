Every heredoc is converted to a string in the default ASCII encoding, but 8-bit chars a silently accepted. There are two tests that rely on that behavior:\n\n```\nt/compilers/imcc/syn/objects.t\nt/library/mime_base64.t\n```\n\nIt should be possible to create a heredoc with an encoding like this:\n\n```\n$S0 = \u003c\u003cutf8:\"EOF\"\nutf8 text here\nEOF\n```\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1796","files":null}]}
