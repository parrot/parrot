Do you have a preference for which? The former seems easier to implement.\n\nIt looks like you also want .write_bytes() and .read_bytes() added to Socket. \n\nI suspect we could add these two methods to the Handle PMC type and inherit from other types. \n\nDo you have any other requests or requirements for this ticket, or is that a good summary?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"76484e451c8adcf68d1a41e60ab7fdf43d921282"},"timestamp":1337262034,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjQxMzM=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/610#issuecomment-5764133"},"message":".write_bytes on FileHandle and .read_bytes and .write_bytes on Socket would be quite nice, and enough for this ticket.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"aef4977f5ea786238d7c9581a2f192f4adc3f39d"},"timestamp":1337390586,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTg2ODA=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/610#issuecomment-5798680"},"message":"I've just pushed some prototype code to the whiteknight/gh_610 branch.
