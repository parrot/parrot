The C abi defines\ncaller cleanup, so we could declare some of them with empty args, but for\nthe sake of API sanity we accept at least 2 args.\n\nAlso do not return unused values, rather cast to (void) and\nstrip PARROT_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT attributes on them.\n```","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"86141a663c2eb7543d1a51ec6253a1d54de912fd"},"timestamp":1394493075,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjQ2MjQ2","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/1052#issuecomment-37246246"},"message":"Merged with 86e504c4b8452dceca0086ac54ae883f2e07e318","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"86141a663c2eb7543d1a51ec6253a1d54de912fd"},"timestamp":1394493075,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTAwNjg3NzY0"},"status":2}]}
