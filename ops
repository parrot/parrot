These things are fine and good for most cases, but frequently (especially when debugging issues related to string and pmc internals) I find that these things are more of a hassle than a benefit and sometimes I want to look at the raw, unpretty output directly.\n\nIn short, I want a way to turn these things off.\n\nThe easiest way I can think of is to add a command-line argument to Configure.pl, --no-pretty-debug or something like that, to remove those lines from the makefile. Or, we can remove those things entirely from the main makefile target and instead add a separate gdb-pretty-print make target to build them if desired.","files":null}]}
