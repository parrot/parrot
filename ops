The threading system maintains a global array of created interpreter objects, and the first thread (the only one without a parent interp) is supposed to create that array. Creating a second interp without a parent enters into the same logic path, tries to fiddle with the global array in ways that aren't good, and we get errors.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe threading system is known to be broken in this and in other ways, and is currently undergoing a redesign. I will keep this ticket open as a reminder, but I am not certain if we are going to fix the bug as-is or if we are going to want to punt and avoid it in a hypothetical future system.\n\u003c/p\u003e","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"aef4977f5ea786238d7c9581a2f192f4adc3f39d"},"timestamp":1319098471,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDMwOTk=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/427#issuecomment-3503099"},"message":"\u003cp\u003e\nI think this issue is resolved following the kill_threads merge.
