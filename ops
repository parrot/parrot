They didn't even bother to file a parrot ticket for it.\nThe other 2 reasons are not parrot related, only nqp-p and rakudo-p.\n\nSo, \n1) either copy the moarvm implementation over to parrot, when they finished their implementation. It's still WIP over there. See `docs/pdds/pdd28_strings.pod` for the specs. They use a trie, not a hash though.\nor\n2) use the ICU Normalizer2 API.","files":null}]}
