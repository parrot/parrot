There aren't a lot of details in these spattered notes, so I don't know whether it suggests we should be able to lookup nested namespaces using such an interface, or NameSpace global entries, or both.\n\nHere's an example of a note from src/global.c:\n\n```\nNOTE: At present the use of the {get, set}_global functions is mandatory due\n      to the wacky namespace typing of the default Parrot namespace.\n      Eventually it will be safe to just use the standard hash interface\n      (if desired).\n```\n\nLet's figure out exactly what these notes mean, what we want the NameSpace interface to be, and make everything right.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1662","files":null}]}
