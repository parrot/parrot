This target will `FAIL` test files which would otherwise `PASS` if they emit warnings.  We should fix all tests such that they run warnings-free.\n\nHere are the files which failed due to warnings:\n\n```\nTest Summary Report\n-------------------\nt/compilers/imcc/syn/const.t      (Wstat: 1280 Tests: 35 Failed: 5)\n  Failed tests:  15-18, 21\n  Non-zero exit status: 5\nt/compilers/imcc/syn/errors.t     (Wstat: 1280 Tests: 7 Failed: 5)\n  Failed tests:  2-5, 7\n  Non-zero exit status: 5\nt/compilers/imcc/syn/macro.t      (Wstat: 512 Tests: 42 Failed: 2)\n  Failed tests:  31-32\n  Non-zero exit status: 2\nt/compilers/imcc/syn/pasm.t       (Wstat: 256 Tests: 1 Failed: 1)\n  Failed test:  1\n  Non-zero exit status: 1\nt/compilers/imcc/syn/regressions.t (Wstat: 256 Tests: 21 Failed: 1)\n  Failed test:  15\n  Non-zero exit status: 1\nt/op/basic.t                      (Wstat: 256 Tests: 23 Failed: 1)\n  Failed test:  23\n  Non-zero exit status: 1\nt/pmc/exception-old.t             (Wstat: 256 Tests: 22 Failed: 1)\n  Failed test:  16\n  Non-zero exit status: 1\nt/pmc/filehandle.t                (Wstat: 512 Tests: 27 Failed: 2)\n  Failed tests:  3, 21\n  Non-zero exit status: 2\nt/pmc/nci.t                       (Wstat: 1280 Tests: 73 Failed: 5)\n  Failed tests:  1-3, 60-61\n  Non-zero exit status: 5\nt/pmc/stringhandle.t              (Wstat: 256 Tests: 25 Failed: 1)\n  Failed test:  9\n  Non-zero exit status: 1\nt/pmc/sub.t                       (Wstat: 768 Tests: 78 Failed: 3)\n  Failed tests:  31-32, 44\n  Non-zero exit status: 3\nFiles=205, Tests=7028, 66 wallclock secs ( 0.87 usr  0.39 sys +\n 37.84 cusr 10.37 csys = 49.47 CPU)\nResult: FAIL\nmake: *** [warnings_tests] Error 1\n```\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1941","files":null}]}
