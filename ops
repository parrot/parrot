Rakudo's splice function is sending incorrect values to Parrot's splice opcode, _and_ there's a problem with Parrot's splice in handling strange offsets and counts.  I can easily fix these in Rakudo and NQP, but I probably need some better idea of Parrot's desired splice opcode semantics for negative counts and offsets beyond the end of the array.  Do we basically want to follow p5 semantics?\n\nPm","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"2da6485217cbb88ff96be8f3dcc7f9ae44cf6bf0"},"timestamp":1345138190,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3OTI3MjU=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/766#issuecomment-7792725"},"message":"I think following p5 semantics for splicing + counts/offsets is a good starting point.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"aef4977f5ea786238d7c9581a2f192f4adc3f39d"},"timestamp":1345142948,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3OTQ5OTQ=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/766#issuecomment-7794994"},"message":"Parrot's splice opcode is not frequently used, and I don't think there's any clear description of what it's semantics are supposed to be (especially for \"strange offsets and counts\").
