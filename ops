Unless somebody with super-powers wants to step up to tackle this project, I think the best course of action is to close it as WONTFIX. It's a nice idea, but way too much work for too little benefit.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"099af60226e2576bd4ff0f5c2614b710c745cab6"},"timestamp":1336527851,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTEwNDI=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/666#issuecomment-5591042"},"message":"-1 for closing it as WONTFIX.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"aef4977f5ea786238d7c9581a2f192f4adc3f39d"},"timestamp":1336528606,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTExNjc=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/666#issuecomment-5591167"},"message":"oh wait, I think I misunderstood what this ticket was asking for. You don't want to reverse the opcodes used, you want to use shift everywhere and not use pop for reverse iterators?
