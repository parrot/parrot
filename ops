This adds it to Socket PMCs.\n\nI'm not entirely sure this is the correct approach - because normally you'd call this before creating a socket object. For PIR this is OK, but in something like Perl 6 this will create a Socket object to call getprotobyname, then destroy it, then probably create another one straight after.\n\nAnyway, this is the best I could come up with given my extremely limited knowledge of Parrot - please advise!\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1724","files":null}]}
