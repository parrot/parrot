This branch removes the .file and .line directives from the parser (both of which appear to have been completely untested). This branch also removes setfile and setline directives and a scant few mentions in tests. We can do more testing after the release when we can start preparing for a merge.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"aef4977f5ea786238d7c9581a2f192f4adc3f39d"},"timestamp":1337217083,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTYxNjM=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/519#issuecomment-5756163"},"message":"I have just merged the whiteknight/imcc_file_line branch.
