However, it still assumes IMCC. I don't know if this is what we want or not. \n\nIn reality, the load_bytecode op and similar built-in loading mechanisms should not automatically compile anything. So long as IMCC is built into Parrot core by default and so long as load_bytecode and other mechanisms take files with \".pir\" and \".pasm\" file extensions this is going to remain a problem","files":null}]}
