If the burden on Rakudo and Partcl (and anyone else using these ops/VTABLE slots) isn't too bad, let's put the VTABLE slots and the \"can\" op through a deprecation cycle.\n\u003c/p\u003e","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"aef4977f5ea786238d7c9581a2f192f4adc3f39d"},"timestamp":1336432897,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NjM0ODU=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/675#issuecomment-5563485"},"message":"I have created the whiteknight/gh_675 branch to remove this vtable.
