I don't quite understand the terminology.\n\nA \"leaked\" thread is a thread created by e.g, pthread_create(),\nwhich was never joined.\nSee e.g, http://code.google.com/p/thread-sanitizer/wiki/CppManual\nor http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10873519/symptoms-of-thread-leak\n\nIt's not critical for us, but a common error that one forgets to join\ncreated\nthreads. And it's a resource leak, cleaned up only by process end.\n\n## \n\nReini Urban\nhttp://cpanel.net/   http://www.perl-compiler.org/","files":null}]}
