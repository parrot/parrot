This is because of the fact that we don't have a separate and distinct extending API in the way that we do have a separate embedding API. Basically, our extending APIs are currently defined at the subsystem level, not at the parrot level.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nNotice that parrot.h is automatically included in some extending situations such as dynops and dynpmcs. It would require significant effort to fix that situation, in addition to the significant effort required to bring a new extending API up to a usable level. I'm not against this idea, but it would be a lot of work.\n\u003c/p\u003e","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"2da6485217cbb88ff96be8f3dcc7f9ae44cf6bf0"},"timestamp":1327885701,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MTMwNjc=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/358#issuecomment-3713067"},"message":"This should have been closed a while ago.","files":null}]}
