At the moment we still require sizeof(INTVAL)==sizeof(opcode_t), so enforcing that with a compile-time check instead of a runtime failure would be awesome. Places where we don't play nicely with non-standard FLOATVAL sizes could also use some of these checks.\n\nGC might have a few uses also, making sure settings for pools and arenas are sane, and other parameters configurable by users through #define. src/gc/gc_private.h could probably use a few of those.\n\nIf we have the tool available, and I see no reason why we shouldn't, we will find uses for it.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e6ebaecce565c58b3e91ddb32c09e93c5f646822"},"timestamp":1332449606,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDgxNDI=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/746#issuecomment-4648142"},"message":"Since it's a compile-time assertion, we could probably put those checks like\n\n```\nPARROT_STATIC_ASSERT( sizeof(INTVAL) == sizeof(opcode_t) );\n```\n\nright into an .h file somewhere.
