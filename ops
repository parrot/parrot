I'm just hoping that we can hear from\n\u0026gt;  Patrick as to his thoughts around ''create_language.pl''.\nSorry it's taken me so long to respond -- I've been trying (and largely\nfailing) to formulate a positive and clear response.  Overall I'm -0.5 on\nthe proposal to merge the two scripts into a single tool.\nAs gerd++ points out earlier in the thread, behind the two tools lie\nstrong differences of opinion regarding the mechanics of the build and\ninstall system.  In fact, the primary reason I abandoned mk_language_shell.pl\nand started create_language.pl is because I was extremely uncomfortable\nwith the many modifications being made to mk_language_shell.pl, and it was\nfar easier to start again from scratch with a new tool than to try to\nwork around the changes being made to the existing one.\nAt this point I'm still strongly in favor of a build system similar to\nwhat create_language.pl, NQP, and Rakudo currently use, and I don't want\nto feel \"encumbered\" by setup.pir.  I don't find the proposal to provide\na \"make vs. setup\" option switch to create_language.pl to be all that\ncompelling; to a large degree I think it just converts the newbie question\nof \"Which script do I choose, and why?\" to \"Which --generate-with= option\ndo I choose, and why?\".  The fact that --generate-with= is proposed to\ndefault to \"setup\" makes me even less happy with the proposed merger, as\nit basically eliminates the whole reason behind why I started\ncreate_language.pl in the first place.\nThe reason my vote is -0.5 instead of a full -1.0 is because I recognize\nthe current situation is not ideal, and I don't have any strong alternatives\nto offer at this time.  I'm also trying to avoid an appearance of\n\"my way of doing things is the only correct answer\", because I do\nacknowledge that there are justifications for the setup.pir approach\nas well and I respect the efforts the setup.pir authors have put into\nthat system.\nSo, I'm not wanting to say \"absolutely don't go down this path\".  I'm\njust trying to flag up that I think that trying to develop a single\nlanguage creation script that supports setup.pir isn't likely\nto work out at all well for the projects I'm working on, I'm not likely\nto support the resulting script if it is merged, and that perhaps\nwe could continue searching for other means of resolving the\nexisting confusion.\nPm\n\u003c/pre\u003e","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"bd4ae1c77edc81aa7bb32abf5c1babd84abdff35"},"timestamp":1284338134,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDM3ODA=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/622#issuecomment-3503780"},"message":"\u003cp\u003e\nI don't care about the default value of \"--genetate-with=\".
