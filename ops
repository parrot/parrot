For example, 't/pmc/task.t' contains no pod and, consequently, does not get reported via 'pod_description.t', but 't/pmc/task_primes.t' does contain pod, though pod without a DESCRIPTION, and, therefore, does get reported.\n\nSo, my guess is, we worry just with those tests which, at this time, fail and leave the others for another day? Also, is it a _goal_ for all of our tests to include some kind of descriptive pod? I mean, is that a goal?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"aeaa659130ab92a2084a11638a6eb1a6beb03360"},"timestamp":1337798449,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4ODExNTY=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/774#issuecomment-5881156"},"message":"Fixing only the files that contain POD without a description will still be a meaningful improvement.
