At least it should be documented.\n`add` uses the correct output type. `mult` just uses the type of the first argument.\n\nWith such arithmetic binops the type variants easily explode. I'll try to fix it. \nThere are also the Big\\* and Complex variants.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"5db01e6955098c59a39e9df4b8bd3f1fdf43341a"},"timestamp":1479315602,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTAwNDg0Ng==","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/1234#issuecomment-261004846"},"message":"Thanks!
