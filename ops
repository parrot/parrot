Please be aware, before you put too much more effort in the current mime/base64 implentation, that I am working on an NCI version using the source for the base64 utility that is part of gnu coreutils .  An earlier 'C' implementation by the author of the coreutils code is referenced in one of the base64 RFCs, so the code there can be expected to adhere to standards well.  I hope to have a working NCI module on github sometime next week.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"86141a663c2eb7543d1a51ec6253a1d54de912fd"},"timestamp":1348601949,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4NjczMzY=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/826#issuecomment-8867336"},"message":"Merged in bf3a079","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"86141a663c2eb7543d1a51ec6253a1d54de912fd"},"timestamp":1348601949,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjU0MDAzNjI="},"status":2}]}
