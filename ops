Either emit `1..0` or throw an error.\n\nTest::More currently will _not_ allow you to plan for 0 tests.  This dates way back to almost the beginning.\n\n```\n$ perl -wle 'use Test::More tests =\u003e 0'\nYou said to run 0 tests at -e line 1.\n```\n\nWhat you can do is declare that you're going to skip all tests.\n\n```\n$ perl -wle 'use Test::More; plan skip_all =\u003e \"The planets are not aligned\"'\n1..0 # SKIP The planets are not aligned\n```\n\nTest::Builder does not allow `plan tests =\u003e 0` even though `1..0` is a valid TAP plan to run no tests.  Test::Builder guards against a plan accidentally being set to 0 (like `use Test::More tests =\u003e @tests` and the first element happens to be 0) and it forces the user to supply a reason for the skip.  Parrot may or may not want to adapt this stricture.\n\nPS  If Parrot does not already, it really should adapt `done_testing` ASAP.  It solves most of the problems with plans.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"099af60226e2576bd4ff0f5c2614b710c745cab6"},"timestamp":1321234511,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MjU4Mjk=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/188#issuecomment-2725829"},"message":"@leto, feel free to add tests for \"plan\" :)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"2da6485217cbb88ff96be8f3dcc7f9ae44cf6bf0"},"timestamp":1328088277,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTU5MTE=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/188#issuecomment-3755911"},"message":"We have sane behavior now, closing","files":null}]}
