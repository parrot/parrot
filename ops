The use of this code comes from its support in PseudoPOD. It is also supported in POD 6.\n\nI think this tag should be rendered either as:\n a. a tooltip\n b. at the end of the section which it is defined\n c. at the end of the page\n\nI like the section note option best. I feel like having these at the end of the page makes them difficult to use, since most chapters are many screens long.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1743","files":null}]}
