This means that Configure.pl will detect my system as being linux, but it also means that symlinks don't work in the build area (ironically, they DO work in /usr/**, but not in /home/austin/parrot).\n\nWhen evaluating capabilities, Configure.pl should check to ensure that symlinks work. Presently, the build fails when trying to link a versioned .so to an unversioned on inside blib/lib. (I work around this by cp'ing it, and restart the make.)\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/799","files":null}]}
