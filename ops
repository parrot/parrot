Every 'optional' feature in our configuration system was added because, at some point in our past, some committer felt that the 'default' features were insufficient.  In fact, lacking an overall PDD for configuration, we have no definitive guide as to what Parrot's configuration process \u003cstrong\u003emust\u003c/strong\u003e discover about a host machine, what it would be \u003cstrong\u003enice to learn\u003c/strong\u003e about a host machine, etc.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n3.
