I suspect bytecode generation will be incorporated into his new PACT project and will not be retrofitted into PCT.

Not just inline nodes, but constants and registers being passed around as strings and the like.  Even PCT's biggest user is re-implementing PCT from scratch then dealing with updating it (QAST), although they're not heading towards bytecode as far as I know.  I say close it and work on whole-sale replacements.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"646f0669ead6eaf64196bebf3884a5eff162357a"},"timestamp":1336574802,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTUwODg5MTk="},"status":2}]}
