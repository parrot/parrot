We currently work around some of these problems with magic environment variables and flags on pbc_to_exe.\n\nThese solutions are crufty and inflexible.\n\nI propose the option to add a second pbc which will be loaded _before_ the main pbc and run. The results of this will be used as the settings with which to run the main pbc.\n\nThe intent of this secondary, preamble, pbc is to parse commandline arguments, environment variables, and config files to obtain parrot VM settings in a manner appropriate for the HLL.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1867","files":null}]}
