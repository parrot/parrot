(That is, once you write a file that details the changes from 2.0 bytecode to 2.6 bytecode and another one with the details of 2.6 bytecode to 3.0 bytecode, the translation tool is smart enough to use the two files to translate 2.0 bytecode to 3.0 bytecode by translating it to 2.6 as an intermediate step.)\n\nThe tool will also have to give warnings about opcodes and PMCs that no longer exist, as these can't be mechanically translated. Tell the user to regenerate the bytecode from source instead.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/598","files":null}]}
