First, it points out a number (240) of failures, many of which actually do have POD description sections of some kind.  docs/pdds/draft/pdd01_overview.pod is an example of this.  Run prove -v t/codingstd/pod_description.t to find more.  For purposes of this test, POD sections such as \"synopsis\" and \"information\" can be considered equivalent to \"description\".  The important thing is that the files have some kind of accurate description.\n\nThe second problem is that some files actually don't contain descriptions.  This is sub-optimal because we want our code to be newbie-friendly.","files":null}]}
