POD in .pmc files (and a couple of others)","message":"We recently completed an exercise whereby the coding standard test t/codingstd/c_function_docs.t and the associated documentation was fixed so that no TODO's remain for missing POD in c functions in parrot.\n\nI had occasion to run make headerizer and found that it reported missing POD in some other files, mostly .pmc files and one .y file (plus 3 .c files from compilers/src/pirc not tested by c_function_docs.t).\n\nIt is suggested that .pmc files be included in c_function_docs.t or possibly in a new test.\n\nat r48245 make headerizer
