In particular\n- the FileHandle has a read_bytes method, but no corresponding write_bytes (or .print() or whatever). Direct binary write operations on FileHandle would be most welcome.\n- the Socket PMC would benefit from a read_bytes method too (or return a ByteBuffer from read(), but that's not backwards compatible)\n- likewise writing a ByteBuffer to a Socket\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2195","files":null}]}
