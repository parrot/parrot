What would have shown up in 'myconfig', 'config_lib.pir' or 'lib/Parrot/Config/Generated.pm' if there had been \"an effect\"?\n\nTonight I configured Parrot with '--m=32' -- and no other command-line options -- and successfully built it on Mac OS X 10.7.5.  The only test failures were those previously reported for nqp-rx.  But other than 'configure_args' =\u003e '\"--m=32\"', I saw no impact in lib/Parrot/Config/Generated.pm.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"646f0669ead6eaf64196bebf3884a5eff162357a"},"timestamp":1355367615,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMzIwNTI4","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/247#issuecomment-11320528"},"message":"I _think_ OP was referring to Apple's GCC's `-m32` option, and expecting there to be a similar configure option for parrot.  A universal version (32/64 via `-arch i386 -arch x86_64`) might be convenient for distributing binaries, but would also require universal versions of all dependencies which seems somewhat rare.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"2da6485217cbb88ff96be8f3dcc7f9ae44cf6bf0"},"timestamp":1364224695,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1Mzk5MjQ2","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/247#issuecomment-15399246"},"message":"@ashgti can you reproduce this on a recent Parrot master or stable release?
