Kakapo did something very similar for a \"super()\" routine that called the overridden implementation. I suspect you can do something very similar for vtables as well, though the interface there is tricker because you can't always invoke the vtable directly, sometimes you need to figure out which opcode leads to which vtable (and what side-effects are caused by that op).\n\nIf we ever move to 6model, eventually almost everything will be a method and many of these inheritance shenanigans can go away permanently. Do we want to try and pursue this ticket before the integration with 6model, or can we wait until after the new object model is in place before worrying about this.","files":null}]}
