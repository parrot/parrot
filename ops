In C99 it's declared as uintval_t. Unfortunately we have to support C89 which doesn't have such declaration. Solution is to provide own define.\n\nExample of usage is in parrot/parrot.h:\n\n```\n * NOTE!  UINTVAL is incorrect below.  It should be UINTPTR or something like\n * that. The equivalent of C99's uintptr_t- a non-pointer data type that can\n * hold a pointer.\n */\n#define D2FPTR(x) UINTVAL2PTR(funcptr_t, PTR2UINTVAL(x))\n#define F2DPTR(x) UINTVAL2PTR(void *, PTR2UINTVAL((funcptr_t) (x)))\n```\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1855","files":null}]}
