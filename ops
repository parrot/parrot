Working around by adding an \"|8\" to the list around line 47 - but fixing the regex to match the MacOS X versions really wanted (I expect 10.3 and 10.4, because 10.1 and 10.2 had issues with rpath linking o.O) - or simply discard any MacOS X support before 10.5 (ppc still supported with 10.5).","files":null}]}
