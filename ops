LexInfo PMC is a name-\u003eindex hash, so iterating over it is going to return integer values for item.value.\n\nSo, that's an explanation of current behavior. Obviously this isn't what we want, what the test code above expects is that we are iterating over the LexPad values, not the LexInfo ones. I'm going to put together a patch to try and fix this.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"aef4977f5ea786238d7c9581a2f192f4adc3f39d"},"timestamp":1336354537,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTQ4NzI5MjI="},"status":2}]}
