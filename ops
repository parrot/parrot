We already do something similar to access ICU's properties database -- see the \"is_uprop\" opcode in src/ops/nqp.ops of the nqp repository.\n\nPm","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"aef4977f5ea786238d7c9581a2f192f4adc3f39d"},"timestamp":1339201774,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMTU3NDY=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/786#issuecomment-6215746"},"message":"Two points:\n1) I've put together a prototype of this new feature in the whiteknight/foldcase_str branch. It is completely untested (mostly because I don't understand it enough to put together a compelling test) but it's relatively straight-forward: Expose the u_strFoldCase function from ICU through the Parrot_str_foldcase function and the new \"foldcase\" op\n\n2) Parrot does aim to provide a string system that fully supports unicode. Any ICU capabilities that Rakudo needs and Parrot doesn't yet provide should be provided by Parrot. Semantic mismatches are something we can deal with on a case-by-case basis (with a preference towards doing what Rakudo wants). If Parrot doesn't have an existing implementation to worry about we can put together whatever Rakudo wants.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"86141a663c2eb7543d1a51ec6253a1d54de912fd"},"timestamp":1455526731,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NDEyMDUxMA==","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/786#issuecomment-184120510"},"message":"rebased to the branch `smoke-me/foldcase_str` and added some testcases. will merge into 8.2.0","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"86141a663c2eb7543d1a51ec6253a1d54de912fd"},"timestamp":1455609892,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NDU2Nzc5OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/786#issuecomment-184567799"},"message":"Will be in 8.2.0, PBC_COMPAT bumped to 13.1","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"86141a663c2eb7543d1a51ec6253a1d54de912fd"},"timestamp":1455609892,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTUxNjU5NzI4"},"status":2}]}
