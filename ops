Notice that this function isn't a part of libparrot, so it's definition certainly doesn't belong in one of the libparrot .h files. It's also not a requirement, it's very plausible to create a frontend program that doesn't provide a function of this name, or its purpose. libparrot does not (or should not) need a config hash provided like this, we've only done it as a matter of convenience.\n\nSo I guess what I'm saying is that this is probably a WONTFIX, but I'd like to see some other opinions on the matter.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"86141a663c2eb7543d1a51ec6253a1d54de912fd"},"timestamp":1413308142,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTc4MzY2MTk3"},"status":2}]}
