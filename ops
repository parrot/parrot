This is not about \"Parrot rejecting Perl 6\" in any way.\n\nnqp-rx is unmaintained, which means that bitrot is setting in, so the question is if it's worth keeping a forever slightly-out-of date version of nqp in the parrot repo or just letting people who want to use nqp build it themselves.\n\nThe idea with ops2c is that rather than spending time updating scripts to deal with nqp changes, it would be easier to go back to the old perl 5 version so more time can be spent improving Parrot for everyone including Rakudo.  We don't have a lot of active developers at the moment, so anything that makes things easier for them to do real work is something to consider.\n\nAnd all that said, that's just an option.
