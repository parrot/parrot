This can undo the set of the constant\nvalue.\n\nSee t/pmc/exception-old_19.pir:\ncont = test() contains a push_eh, and the subsequent pop_eh at cont() changes\nthe value of the constant redux from 0 back to 1. So constant propagation for\nredux=0 cannot delete \"if redux goto done\" and the done branch.\n```\n\nOnce can think of a further -O3 optimization (together with more constant folding)\nto check for push_eh and pop_eh in any subsequent ops even across function \ncall boundaries, and allow propagation if not found.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"86141a663c2eb7543d1a51ec6253a1d54de912fd"},"timestamp":1393859179,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQ5ODMyNjc5MA=="},"status":1},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"86141a663c2eb7543d1a51ec6253a1d54de912fd"},"timestamp":1393859180,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTgzMjY4MDE="},"status":2}]}
