FileHandle and other types that act as low-level wrappers around system resources (Handle, Socket, ByteBuffer, etc) should probably not be inherited from. In other words, you would do better to implement a HAS-A relationship instead of an IS-A relationship with FileHandle. I'll look at the code again to see if there is an obvious and easy way to fix this example, but I suspect there is not.","files":null}]}
