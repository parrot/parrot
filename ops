Our current implementation of it is very bad anyway.\n\nIf HLLs or other projects want singletons, they should be able to implement the behavior themselves.\n\nTypes such as Env and OS don't have state so don't need to be singletons. They are basically just collections of methods, and it's very cheap for us to just create multiple copies of them if needed.\n\nThe scheduler is a different story. It does have state, so we need to only have one of those in the system at a time. There are ways to prevent users from creating a scheduler from PIR code. The scheduler reference is available (or should be) by introspecting the current interp PMC.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2038","files":null}]}
