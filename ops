That is, there are only a\nhandful or two of minor, trival even, modifications across all nine episodes.\nStill, it appears, to my uneducated eye, the version we html'ify is the more\ncurrent one.\n\nI base this on (1) a few typos which appear in the \"squaak-tutorial\" repo, but\ndo NOT also appear on the html'ified one we distrubte with Parrot and\n(2) a single incorrect reference to one of the pdds in the \"squaak-tutorial\"\nrepo, but is correct in the html'ified version.\n\nIn addition -- though I do NOT base my conclusion on this (because these kinds\nof comments, themselves, are often out-of-date :) -- I do want to point out,\nthough you, probably, are already aware of this -- a comment to the\n\"squaak-tutorial\", specifically states, \"A repo I used to update the Squaak\ntutorial.  This repo is now out-of-date.
