This would be very helpful for new developers for getting an idea of how everything fits together.\n\nOne way this might be implemented would be to check to see if graphviz is installed during configure, and then if so, generating the graphs during make once everything has been generated by the build tools. If graphviz is not available, a simple indented text file would be nice.\n\nAny reasons why this is unnecessary or impossible?\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/959","files":null}]}
