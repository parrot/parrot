This is especially true now that Rakudo uses it's own dispatcher and doesn't use the Parrot version, so we're more free to implement something new without worrying about Rakudo breaking.\n\nI say we mothball this ticket now, and try to make MultiSub more sane when we rewrite it later.","files":null}]}
