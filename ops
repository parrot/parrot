This looks like it is because it uses an internal var called max and assumes arrays always have size greater than 1.\n\nA workaround is to force an array of size 1 to be of size 2.\n\nAn example test.pir to be attached.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/486 by bsdz","files":null}]}
