We have a way to make Key PMCs at runtime from PIR or higher. Here is one example of that mechanism (it's ugly, but it does exist):\n\nhttps://github.com/Whiteknight/parrot-linear-algebra/blob/master/t/testlib/matrixtestfactory.nqp#L7\n\nWe either don't have, or I'm not aware of, a mechanism to create a Key which uses a register reference:\n\n$P0[$I0; $S0] = $P1\n\nThis is going to be necessary for doing self-hosted compilation in places like PACT.","files":null}]}
