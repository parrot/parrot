Such a test would need to use environ from a dynpmc. This is not needed as every dynpmc or dynoplib should go through the Env.pmc to access environ.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"86141a663c2eb7543d1a51ec6253a1d54de912fd"},"timestamp":1357845107,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzQwMTQyOTg="},"status":2}]}
