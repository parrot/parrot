This occurs when you have \nread upto the last byte of a file (e.g. when a readline reads up to the \nend of a newline, and that newline is the last thing in the file), but \nnot beyond (which seems to be what causes the EOF flag to be set). I'm \nthinking this is the wrong behaviour?\n\nThoughts and fixes welcome!\n\nJonathan\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1212","files":null}]}
