I'm closing this ticket. I haven't seen any issues in my gc_finalize branch which re-enables global finalization, which is where we've seen these order-of-destruction issues in the past. Also, the references that were relying on ordered destruction no longer exist between Scheduler/Task, etc so I don't think this particular case is a problem anymore. (We can open new tickets if we find other instances of expected order of destruction).","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"aef4977f5ea786238d7c9581a2f192f4adc3f39d"},"timestamp":1336522204,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTUwNDUyMDE="},"status":2}]}
