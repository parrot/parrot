I am not sure how our garbage collector\ninteracts with the real-time-ness of RTEMS, though. It probably needs to be\nshut off currently (parrot -G), to retain realtime characteristics. I have been\ndoing research on realtime gc algorithms, there are a few implemented\non the JVM, JeRTY VM and Jikes RVM. The \"Tortured History\nof Real-Time Garbage Collectors\" also seems like an interesting read.\n\nhttp://leto.net/dukeleto.pl/2009/11/realtime-embedded-parrots.html\n\nhttp://developers.sun.com/learning/javaoneonline/2007/pdf/TS-2901.pdf\n\nhttp://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/ISORC.2005.45\n\nhttp://www.research.ibm.com/people/d/dfb/papers/Bacon03Realtime.pdf\n\nhttp://www.cs.wustl.edu/~mdeters/doc/slides/rtgc-history.pdf\n\nAny changes to the GC API should take into account that a realtime GC algorithm should be possible.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1352","files":null}]}
