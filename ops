But they all need to know about the 1st interp that was created, which, from a security standpoint, is suboptimal. Here is a snippet from PL/Parrot's plparrot.c :\n\n```\n    untrusted_interp = Parrot_new(NULL);\n\n    /* Must use the first created interp as the parent of subsequently created interps */\n    trusted_interp = Parrot_new(untrusted_interp);\n\n```\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1880","files":null}]}
