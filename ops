The problem\nis that everything in string_funcs.h is defined only if PARROT_IN_CORE is\ndefined. PARROT_IN_CORE, in turn, is defined only if I include parrot.h\n```\n\nSince only parrot internals should include parrot/parrot.h, these functions need to be made available from parrot/embed.h and parrot/extend.h\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1496","files":null}]}
