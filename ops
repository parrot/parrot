(I was working on a different ticket where I needed to see what difference `--optimize` made in `%PConfig`.)\n\nGiven what some would consider the antiquity of this platform, this is hardly a deal-breaker.   Still, a bug is a bug, and it would be worthwhile if someone could speculate on why optimization made this bug manifest and how it might be fixed.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nkid51\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1930","files":null}]}
