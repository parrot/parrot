I think it should be MAX_INT, if we care about ieee754-2008, but I have to verify that. Also, is it documented or tested anywhere that this should print \"5\" instead of \"5.0\" ?\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre class=\"wiki\"\u003eparrot_shell 5\u0026gt; $P1 = box \"5\"\n$N1 = $P1\nsay $N1\n.\nTime: 0.0160158 wallclock secs\nOutput:\n5\n\u003c/pre\u003e","files":null}]}
