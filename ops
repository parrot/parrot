Why does Configure.pl autodetect the number of CPUs?  Shouldn't this be something that happens at Parrot runtime?  (Is it that way already?)\n\nWhat happens in the case where someone is creating a Debian package binary for Parrot?  Does the # of CPUs on the build machine then become the value for all users of that binary?\n\n(Apologies if these questions are naive or misplaced -- it just seems odd to me that Configure.pl would count CPUs in relation to threading.)\n\nPm","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"2da6485217cbb88ff96be8f3dcc7f9ae44cf6bf0"},"timestamp":1355250783,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMjU2MDEx","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/878#issuecomment-11256011"},"message":"I think I was mistaken.
