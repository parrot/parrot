They are listed in `--help`, `docs/running.pod`, and even seem to be parsed.  However, they don't actually _do_ anything.\n- `-d` / `--imcc-debug`\n- `-v` / `--verbose`\n- `-O` / `--optimize`\n- `-y` / `--yydebug`\n\nIt's been suggested that the best thing to do with them is to just remove them.  Some could be hooked up to actual code, as the machinery in IMCC for debugging and yydebug still exist.\n\n**Issue 3:** The `-p` / `--profile` option is listed in `docs/running.pod`, but doesn't appear to actually exist.  Is this expected to work in any way?","files":null}]}
