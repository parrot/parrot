It appears that nci does not have a good way of passing a rw buffer of data to an external function and retrieving it later and whiteknight had some ideas about how to add the missing functionality.  The functionality provided by the nci 'B' signature comes close but will discard changes to the data before returning.\n\nThis ticket is being posted at Mr Whitworth's request and if I have any misunderstanding about what was wanted please feel free to add correction comments etc.  A link to the IRC discussion is here [http://irclog.perlgeek.de/parrot/2010-09-18#i_2840413].\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1799","files":null}]}
