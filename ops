PARROT_DATA should have taken care of this.\nThe bad news is that one trips over this issue only when data, like PMCNULL, is used.  For functions, the compiler generates a thunk that does an extra jump, but there's no way to apply this indirection for data.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"aef4977f5ea786238d7c9581a2f192f4adc3f39d"},"timestamp":1336350671,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NDIxOTM=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/199#issuecomment-5542193"},"message":"Is this still an issue on windows?
