This privileged status is part of why PIR is a growing pain for Parrot (usually experienced as hatred for IMCC).\n\nPIR will become no different to parrot than any language. It will not be baked-in to libparrot and be always available. In stead, PIR will become a separately loadable component.\n\nPIR will remain available to Parrot programs, however it will require loading before use (via the load_language instruction).\n\nA separate executable (tentatively named \"parrot-imcc\") will be made available for compiling and running PIR programs as the main parrot executable does today.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1868","files":null}]}
