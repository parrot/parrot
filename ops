Parrot is driving away Perl 6 developer. There are indications that Parrot always complains whenever Perl 6 developers contribute C code to Parrot. But I never see negative complaint when Perl 6 developers contribute code to Perl 6. Maybe it's not true, but that's what I faintly feel last three years.\n\nI think it's still good to include ext/nqp, so Parrot knows when she was changed, she breaks nqp.

This is not about \"Parrot rejecting Perl 6\" in any way.\n\nnqp-rx is unmaintained, which means that bitrot is setting in, so the question is if it's worth keeping a forever slightly-out-of date version of nqp in the parrot repo or just letting people who want to use nqp build it themselves.\n\nThe idea with ops2c is that rather than spending time updating scripts to deal with nqp changes, it would be easier to go back to the old perl 5 version so more time can be spent improving Parrot for everyone including Rakudo.  We don't have a lot of active developers at the moment, so anything that makes things easier for them to do real work is something to consider.\n\nAnd all that said, that's just an option.  If people want to put the work in to update parrot-nqp to the new nqp, that's great: it has some improvements that I, for one, would love to see as part of core.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"3771fd696fba286f6d0b9544dc89da489f0c740e"},"timestamp":1346901614,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMjEzMTM=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/818#issuecomment-8321313"},"message":"@Benabik - So why opsc was born?
