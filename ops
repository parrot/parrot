Everything is pass-by-reference in Fortran, even integers and floats.\n\nget_pointer should return the address of the wrapped primitive. This will have some security concerns, and in the future there should be a flag to allow or disable this.\n\nThe new get_pointer vtables will look something like this:\n\n```\nVTABLE void*get_pointer() { return \u0026(PARROT_INTEGER(SELF)-\u003evalue); }\n```","files":null}]}
