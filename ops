It not only has a more-or-less completely separate object system, 6model, but also separate dynamic call and big integer libraries.\n\nThat said, I think we do need to seriously look at stealing back everything from nqp into core.  I'd have no arguments if dyncall, tommath, and 6model all were integrated into Parrot.  I'd prefer integration over simple bundling.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"aef4977f5ea786238d7c9581a2f192f4adc3f39d"},"timestamp":1330916605,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTYwMzE=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/724#issuecomment-4316031"},"message":"I agree with benabik. We already want to \"borrow\" 6model from nqp into Parrot core. Getting some of the other features like dyncall and tommath would be interesting ideas as well.\n\nNQP-rx is old and showing its age. A more modern NQP would bring a lot of improvements and benefits. Not the least of which is more motivation to finally migrate 6model to Parrot core.\n\n+1","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"099af60226e2576bd4ff0f5c2614b710c745cab6"},"timestamp":1330917528,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTYxNDg=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/724#issuecomment-4316148"},"message":"Guys.\n\nI didn't said _how_ it should be done.
