In both cases cygwin is not on the path.  One is an XP machine with strawberry Perl and the other is a Vista machine with ActiveState Perl and mingw.  The error output above is for strawberry Perl.  I remember seeing such popups at times past but don't see them now.  I retested \"perl Configure.pl\" on each and noted the \"auto::readline (etc) .... no\" without the symptoms.\n\u003c/p\u003e","files":null}]}
