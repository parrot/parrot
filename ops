When the PMC is used later it's considered dead (on the free list), but somebody is still holding a reference to it.\n\nWhen you use --optimize, the assertion disappears and the inconsistent data should indeed cause a segfault.\n\nTracing down these kinds of issues is notoriously difficult. Because of the nature of this bug, I _suspect_ that the root cause of it might be in the nativecall implementation or in the code that's being called, keeping a PMC reference but not properly marking that PMC for GC. I'll do what I can to look at this issue tonight or sometime this week.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"c750eb0960e029df836e56dc77bb8c148fcf5723"},"timestamp":1348285820,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3ODUyODI=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/801#issuecomment-8785282"},"message":"The example code linked in the RT (http://hoelz.ro/files/assertion-failure.p6) is no longer available.
