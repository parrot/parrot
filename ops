There are currently five tests failing tests involving `pow` fail with `error:imcc:syntax error, unexpected NREG, expecting '(' ('$N102')`.  This is because the pow opcode was moved to trans.ops.  All abc programs should load that oplib.  Bonus points for only loading it when needed.  This should be fairly simple for someone to do.\n\n(A test used to fail fail because variables were referenced in the same namespace as the compiler, causing `abc` to mean the full namespace.  This was fixed in bacd9dd.)","files":null}]}
