According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_twister at least PHP, Python, and Ruby use the more advanced (but still not cryptographically secure) Mersenne Twister in their standard libraries.  Users from those languages will expect the higher-quality PRNG, so we should do at least as well -- either by switching to a free Mersenne Twister implementation, or by choosing an even more advanced algorithm instead.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/923","files":null}]}
