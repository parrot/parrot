Don't do this. Parrot_compile_file should take a PMC\\* argument for a compiler object to use, and the user should be able to either specify a default compiler to use, or should be able to set up a mapping between file-extension/mime-type -\u003e compiler at the global/interpreter level.\n\nBetter yet, create a new function with a better name and the new signature, deprecate Parrot_compile_file, and migrate over time.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2135","files":null}]}
