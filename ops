These failures occur whether or not I configure with `--optimize`.  Typical messages from my build log:\n\n```\n20120317.26902c1.master.gppopt.txt:589:frontend/parrot2/main.c:170: \n    error: invalid conversion from 'const void*' to 'const unsigned char*'\n20120317.26902c1.master.gppopt.txt:590:frontend/parrot2/main.c:170: \n    error:   initializing argument 2 of 'Parrot_Int Parrot_api_load_bytecode_bytes(PMC*, const unsigned char*, Parrot_Int, PMC**)'\n20120317.26902c1.master.gppopt.txt:591:make: *** [frontend/parrot2/main.o] Error 1\n```\n\nMy more frequent \"all gcc\" builds are succeeding and testing correctly with and without `--optimize`.\n\nThis is disquieting so soon before a monthly release and needs more investigation.\n\nThank you very much.\nJim Keenan","files":null}]}
