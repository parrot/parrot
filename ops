Overriding them on Integer/Float to return the appropriate value works, as most HLL implementors are just going to subclass the core variants.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe operations themselves are going to eventually going to ask the PMC for its int value or float value before manipulating the value - I'm not convinced yet that it's necessary for have a generic op type that would need to ask the PMC how it wants to be treated - having separate op variants for int vs. float vs. string does not seem /too/ onerous.\n\u003c/p\u003e","files":null}]}
