Since YYID was not documented as internal-only, many projects, including Parrot, did use YYID in their .y files.\n\nOn 2012-08-03 (first released in 3.0), Bison removed YYID as part of removing support for `lint`.\nSince YYID was internal-only, its removal was not highlighted as an incompatible change in the release notes.\n\nI tested simply changing `while (YYID (0))` to `while (0)` in compilers/imcc/imcc.y . Those tests look OK under Bison 2.3 and 3.0. It might introduce new lint errors, but probably not, given Lint developments since 2005.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"86141a663c2eb7543d1a51ec6253a1d54de912fd"},"timestamp":1393275530,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDk2MzY5Mzg3"},"added":["Component-imcc"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"86141a663c2eb7543d1a51ec6253a1d54de912fd"},"timestamp":1393275538,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDk2MzY5NDQw"},"added":["Pri-minor"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"86141a663c2eb7543d1a51ec6253a1d54de912fd"},"timestamp":1393275542,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDk2MzY5NDkz"},"added":["Sev-low"],"removed":[]},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"86141a663c2eb7543d1a51ec6253a1d54de912fd"},"timestamp":1393276125,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTYzNzMyMTE="},"status":2},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"86141a663c2eb7543d1a51ec6253a1d54de912fd"},"timestamp":1393277629,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTQxNzU3","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/1031#issuecomment-35941757"},"message":"Fixed with commit 90e3128edec0d940d465d8a6217f907913946cf4\nAuthor: Reini Urban rurban@cpanel.net\nDate:   Mon Feb 24 14:54:42 2014 -0600\n\n```\n[imcc] bison 3 fixes and more [gh #1031]\n\nFix #1031 compat with bison 3: remove deprecated and unneeded YYID macro\nnote one remaining shift/reduce conflict in arglist:  STRINGC ADV_ARROW var at ADV_ARROW\nchange deprecated %pure_parser to new %pure-parser\nregenerate compilers/imcc/imcparser.[ch]\n\nNote: repro with perl Configure.pl --maintainer\n```","files":null}]}
