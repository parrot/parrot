When I ack for that method, I see that it is found in the following files, which I am listing here for reference during refactoring:\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n$ ack -l genfile  lib/ config/ t/configure/ t/steps/\nlib/Parrot/Configure/Compiler.pm\nconfig/gen/config_h.pm\nconfig/gen/config_pm.pm\nconfig/gen/makefiles.pm\nt/configure/034-step.t\nt/steps/gen/makefiles-01.t\n\u003c/pre\u003e","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"d9b4aee65ce8c18d4a43eced1eecb0d154e1eebb"},"timestamp":1327207776,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDExODQ=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/240#issuecomment-3601184"},"message":"I have begun working on this issue in the `240/fix_cond_eval` branch.","files":null}]}
