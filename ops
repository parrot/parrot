For example, the get_class_p_s and newclass_p_s opcodes respectively get and put a class by name, and neither documents which namespace the name is in. The get_namespace/get_root_namespace/get_hll_namespace trio, and related ops, make clear that there are three different namespace roots that could be intended.\n\n-zefram","files":null}]}
