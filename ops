Note that the changes to src/nci/extra_thunks.c are generated by tools/dev/mk_nci_thunks.pl but are included here as the .c file is under version control and I don't think it's genned by the Makefile.\n\nSee also the irc discussion here: [http://irclog.perlgeek.de/parrot/2010-09-18#i_2840413]\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1795","files":null}]}
