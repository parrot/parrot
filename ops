The purpose of these directories is not always self-evident and personally, I still don't know what they all are for. I don't see any immediate disadvantages to this other than a small increase in size. Even so, if the cost of further clarifying our directory structure is just a couple extra kilobytes, I say \"so what.\"\n\nThe format of each README should be consistent and in plain text. Perhaps something like:\n\n```\nDirectory: [name]\nSummary: [short summary]\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\n[more verbose description]\n\nSubdirectories\n--------------\n\n[name - short summary]\n[name - short summary]\n...\n```\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2155","files":null}]}
