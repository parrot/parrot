I suppose we can work around this by having PCT/NQP always explicitly marking the first sub as :main.... but that seems problematic also (especially if PCT/NQP is generating code that is intended to be .include'd as part of a much larger PIR source, as is the case for many things in Rakudo.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe ticket claims that implicit :main needs to be eliminated to enable validation of 0-arity subs... but the discussion in #parrotsketch cited above clearly says that the two issues (checking arity and marking :main) are orthogonal issues and should not have been linked.  I agree with that assessment, and thus there's no strong reason for removing implicit :main.  I think we should continue to allow implicit :main, and simply enable arity checking on all subs.  The ability to write a :main (implicit or explicit) with no parameters is all that needs deprecating.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nPm\n\u003c/p\u003e","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"d9b4aee65ce8c18d4a43eced1eecb0d154e1eebb"},"timestamp":1294114754,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDM2MTc=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/571#issuecomment-3503617"},"message":"\u003cp\u003e\nplobsing (or anyone with more git foo than me):\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nFor the reasons described by fperrad and pmichaud above, please revert this commit as soon as possible.
