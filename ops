If I were trying to achieve this for the macport of parrot, e.g., I'd probably do this in the macport itself, not in parrot.\n\nQuestion: let's say someone gives a prefix (??) and and suffix, so parrot is now:\n\nsuper-parrot-3.6\n\nwhen we install, do we also install a non-suffixed version, so that \n\nsuper-parrot\n\nis still pointing to the latest version?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"4277d85693ce7ae3559eb0a94f3b50be93446600"},"timestamp":1337272738,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjgwNDg=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/712#issuecomment-5768048"},"message":"\u003e This is doable, but I wonder what other projects do.\n\nGCC comes with `--program-prefix` and `--program-suffix` so you can have multiple compiler versions and cross compilers on the same host system.

This is primarily useful if you have more than one install of a library. For instance, on OS X (in Lion), python is sym linked to python-2.7, but python-2.5, and python-2.6 are also present. They each have their own library path as well, so you don't accidentally compile an extension to one and use it on another version of python.\n\nMostly, this is a request so you can have multiple versions of parrot installed and used and they won't interfere with each other.\n\nI ran into a problem on OS X trying to setup the homebrew formula for parrot and rakudo star. Rakudo star comes with its own bundled version of parrot, but if you install say: rakudo\\* then parrot, it overrides some of the binaries and rakudo\\* breaks. So, I looked at how other programs do this and a few programs like gcc solve it by doing the whole prefix/suffix thing.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"183b3c8534dac7310ab46665f68c2637a0fbd554"},"timestamp":1337275636,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjkxNzY=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/712#issuecomment-5769176"},"message":"@coke In gcc its really common to use both. for instance, I have avr-gcc-4.6 installed on my computer.
