The register should be filled with PMCNULL, or an exception should be thrown.\n\nIn stead, the register is filled with the invocant. While this allows for a nifty chaining accidental feature, this is not what is expected in these situations.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1929","files":null}]}
