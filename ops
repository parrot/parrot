That subroutine -- it's not really a method call, it just happens to have two arguments each of which is an object -- is invoked exactly once, inside `Parrot::Pmc2c::Parser::find_methods()`.  The context in which `rewrite_multi_sub()` is invoked is one in which two other subroutines, `Parrot::Pmc2c::PCCMETHOD::rewrite_pccmethod()` and `Parrot::Pmc2c::PCCMETHOD::mangle_name` are invoked.\n\nLet's move `rewrite_multi_sub()` to lib/Parrot/Pmc2c/PCCMETHOD.pm so that all three subroutines can be imported from the same place.  That will enable us to eliminate file lib/Parrot/Pmc2c/MULTI.pm entirely.\n\nIf there is no objection, I will merge the `eliminate_multi` branch into master on Tuesday so that it can run in master for a week before the juneteenth release.\n\nThank you very much.\nJim Keenan","files":null}]}
