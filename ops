See \"perl Configure.pl --help\" for valid options\n```\n\n(See Configure.pl and lib/Parrot/Configure/Options/Conf.pm.)   This is the case notwithstanding documentation to that effect in tools/dev/create_language.pl, docs/pdds/pdd30_install.pod and tools/dev/all_hll_test.pl.\n\nThe outdated nature of the documentation in tools/dev/create_language.pl is demonstrated by the references to 'svn' -- the version control system we haven't used since approximately October 2010.\n\nThe Parrot team will be looking into these documentation errors.  In the meantime, if you use IRC, I'd recommend you log on to #parrot on irc.perl.org and discuss your language creation objectives with Parrot developers on that channel.\n\nThank you very much.\nJim Keenan","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"d9b4aee65ce8c18d4a43eced1eecb0d154e1eebb"},"timestamp":1331949901,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTEzMDM=","github-url":"https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/737#issuecomment-4551303"},"message":"Also, you may try this sequence of commands:\n\n```\nperl Configure.pl\nmake\nperl tools/dev/mk_language_shell.pl xyz [path/to/language]\n```\n\nFor more documentation, try:\n\n```\nperldoc tools/dev/mk_language_shell.in\n```","files":null}]}
