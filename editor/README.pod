=head1 Syntax Highlighting and Other Editor Assistance

Included in this directory are some add-ins for making working on parrot (or in
parrot) easier, for various popular editors. Mostly that means
syntax-highlighting and automatic indenting. Read on to see what's available for
your favorite editor

=head2 Vim

There are several files here, all with the C<.vim> extension. C<imc.vim>
(generated from C<imc.vim.in>), C<pasm.vim>, and C<pmc.vim> are syntax
files; C<indent_imc.vim> is an indent plugin;  and C<filetype_parrot.vim> is a
filetype script that tells vim to associate the extensions .imc, .imcc, .pasm,
and .pmc with the right syntax. The syntax files should be installed to
C<~/.vim/syntax/>; C<filetype_parrot.vim> should be installed to
C<~/.vim/ftdetect>; C<indent_imc.vim> should be called C<~/.vim/indent/imc.vim>.
C<make> in the C<editor/> dir will do this automatically. If you want indenting,
you should also place C<filetype indent on> somewhere in your vimrc.

=head2 Kate

There is a syntax file for the KDE editor Kate, but it is not built by default.
 make imc.kate
in C<editor/> to build it.

TODO: How do we install Kate syntax files?

=head2 Emacs

Included here is an Emacs mode for editing pasm files, in C<pasm.el>.

To install the pasm major mode copy C<pasm.el> to a directory where Emacs
looks for external packages and add the following to your C<~/.emacs> file:

    (load "pasm")

To automatically associate .pasm files with this major mode add:

    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist (cons "\\.pasm\\'" 'pasm-mode))

to your C<~/.emacs> or you can alternatively type C<M-x pasm-mode> for every
file that you want to use the major mode in.

Additionally, you might want to add:

    (add-hook 'pasm-mode-hook
              (function (lambda ()
                          (setq indent-tabs-mode nil))))

to C<~/.emacs> as this seems to prevent the odd behavior that is noted when 
using tabs in the pasm mode.

=head2 TAGS file

There is a script here to automatically generate a TAGS file, which works with
Vim and other editors that recognize ctags-format files. The tool "exuberant
ctags" is required. Run
 make tags
in the parrot root directory to build the tags file.
