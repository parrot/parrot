2003-07-21 17:31 chromatic
	* applied copyright patch from Josh Wilmes

2003-06-14 13:50 dan
	* Moved the registers out of the context structure, since they
          really aren't context
	* Changed the register stack frames to hold only 16 registers
	  rather than 32, added half-set push and pop ops, and reworked
	  the full set push/pops to do two half-set push/pops. Should
	  speed up saving register data on calls, since we usually only
	  care about the top half of the registers anyway.
	* Started committing some of the new class/object framework
	* Remembered to finally start updating the Changelog

2003-03-18 03:50  ask

2002-03-18 16:42  dan

	* memory.c, resources.c: Partial fix for GC's memory trouncing. At
	least we consider the PMC and Buffer free pools worth collecting,
	and initialize the Buffer pool stuff.  Still not 100% correct,
	though.

2002-03-18 15:35  simon

	* packfile.c:

2002-03-17 21:35  ajgough

	* types/: bignum.c, bignum_atest.pl: Added a couple of quick routes
	through addition and subtraction.  Also added the ability to run
	all the tests, including the ones which deal with overflow and
	underflow.  These fail, but that's expected.  Soon they'll pass.
	Then I'll show them.  Yesssssss.  Tessssssssts my precioussssss,
	passsssssssings tesssstsssss.

2002-03-17 20:06  ajgough

	* types/: bignum.c, bignum.h, bignum_test.pl: Modified
	check_(under|over)flow to test bignumbers, rather than values.
	context now carries E_limit, from which max and min exp are found.

	Added a default-context-creating function (although this isn't the
	same as either of the default contexts defined in the eda).

2002-03-17 13:31  ajgough

	* types/: bignum.c, bignum.h: Made BN_round and BN_iround so that

	* types/: bignum.c, bignum.h: Lots of prototypes changed in
	readiness for nicely telling your caller about any oddness you've
	caused in the persuit of flow.

	it.

2002-03-16 16:58  dan

	* resources.c, vtable.tbl, classes/default.pmc,
	include/parrot/resources.h: Added the last code to let PMCs control
	their marking at DOD time

2002-03-16 16:57  ajgough

	* types/bignum.c: Ok, I worked out how to not have lots of tabs.  I
	feel a little more virtuous now.  Really I do.	You might not
	believe me, but you should.  perl -pne 's/\t/	     /g', if you're
	curious.

2002-03-16 16:57  josh

	* packfile.c, packout.c: M-x untabify is my new friend.

2002-03-16 16:50  josh

	* trace.c, resources.c: Minor whitespace tweak for the benefit of
	check_source_standards.pl

2002-03-16 16:50  ajgough

	* types/: bignum.c, bignum.h: More documentation, separate
	functions into public and private sorts, some initial stuff to cope
	with over and underflow correctly.

	* io/TODO: Get the TODO up-to-date for 0.0.4.

2002-03-16 16:11  josh

	* Configure.pl: Patch from Nicholas Clark <nick@unfortu.net>: stops
	silly people (such as me) running Configure with
	/usr/local/bin/perl (which is 5.004_05) and not realising their
	mistake until the pmc subdirectory, where the first qr// is
	encountered.

	Syntax error messages don't tell you what you did wrong. This does:

	/usr/local/bin/perl Configure.pl Perl 5.00503 required--this is
	only version 5.00405, stopped at Configure.pl line 10.

2002-03-16 14:38  ajgough

	classes/perlstring.pmc, classes/perlundef.pmc,
	include/parrot/pmc.h, core.ops, pmc.c, vtable.tbl: Add size

	Introduced exception handlers and exception flags to context, will
	allow support of extended standard.  Unified exception checking
	mechanism (sort of) and made minimal changes to bulk of code to use

	were beforehand.  2) Feel free to bicker with names.  I don't think
	we've come to *any* sort of agreement with these, although we
	really, really, need to.  3) I forget the third thing.	4) But I
	thought of a fourth.  5) I've now remembered the third thing: IIRC,
	ANSI C states that enums will fit within the smallest type (int or
	greater) that can hold the values. Is that actually correct, and
	does it state whether unsigned is preferred to signed for
	non-negative enums? 6) Since I'm no longer constrained by "three"
	or "quick", I'm going size_t happy for a lot of memory-related
	storage.  (That's good.  No sense wasting the size or performance
	of an UINTVAL for strange values of UINTVAL.)  I'm also using it in
	a couple other internal things (like the GC stat counters, seen
	here).	Size and performance, again, and unpromotable to a bigint,
	so we know that we (theoretically) will wrap.  However, size_t
	isn't the best choice for the type.  (Not that there's anything
	wrong with size_t, just that it shouldn't be called size_t.)  Any
	thoughts?  I was thinking of just doing unsigned int, because,
	IIRC, int is usually the natural word size, and will be most
	efficient.  Thoughts? 7) I forgot what the fourth thing I thought
	of was while writing down the others.  Sorry.

	* docs/pdds/: pdd0.pod, pdd00_pdd.pod: The pod version of PDD 0 in
	CVS seems to have several chunks missing out of it, too.  This
	patch is simply an administrative patch, with the differences
	between my last version, and the one currently in there.  There
	will be a forthcoming patch for some minor tweaking to the PDD, but
	I wanted a common baseline before I make any (potential) semantic
	changes.

	There's only one semi-major change, which noone needs to worry
	about just yet.  That's a change from PDD Format 1 to PDD Format
	6.0 - rationale can be found under 'Standard (Version #)' of the
	STANDARDS TRACK infomation.  Don't worry about this yet, because it
	should be 6.0.0, and we need to discuss Perl versus Parrot with
	PDDs.

	* packfile.c, resources.c, examples/assembly/life.pasm,
	include/parrot/register.h, include/parrot/resources.h,
	include/parrot/string.h: First pass of semi-full GC. (Strings only,
	no PMCs yet)

	This patch now implements a real copying collector. We trace from
	our root set and compact the contents of Buffer structs.

	Todo:

	*) It's very STRING-centric and doesn't handle memory stuffed in
	Buffers.  But, then, we don't have pool allocation for Buffers
	either, and we need to have that soonish for this to work.

	*) Doesn't trace PMCs, so if you trigger a collection and there's
	memory or STRING structs only accessible from PMCs, you'll fail
	horribly. That needs fixing too

	*) Better algorithms for when to trace or collect vs when to just
	go allocate more memory from the system. Should probably be more
	cache friendly too.

	following test scripts now all pass: divide divideint add multiply

	hints/mswin32.pl - remove a space from Configure.pl (very very
	important for bcc) - add a O_BINARY flag to open() in pdump.c,
	embed.c (required by bcc) - define O_BINARY 0 when it's not defined
	(win32 knows it, linux not)

	and the why: - parrot is MUCH faster when compiled with borland c
	(make test on p2-450, 320MB):	* msvc++: 313 seconds	* bcc: 251

2002-02-11 00:34  simon

	* core.ops, include/parrot/exceptions.h:
	This is what keyed set ops look like. Remember, however, that for
	keyed functions, all operands must be PMCs. set(PMC, PMC, INT)
	means $1 = $2[$3], not $1[$2] = $3. set(PMC,PMC,PMC) is so
	obviously ambiguous that you ought to use the 4-arg version
	instead.

	* classes/: array.pmc, perlarray.pmc: Properly allocate

	should be done in the next few days.

2002-02-07 04:49  mrjoltcola

	* examples/assembly/bsr.pasm: Elaborated on the bsr/ret example,
	added a nested subroutine call.

2002-02-07 04:32  jgoff

	* vtable.tbl, lib/Parrot/Vtable.pm: vtable.tbl got some minor
	changes in order to give the whitespace rules a little workout, and
	do a little bit more testing. No actual structural changes were
	made.  lib/Parrot/Vtable.pm got an interface change, and more
	importantly should be ready to support the new '_keyed' attribute,
	which will work roughly thus: PMC* src_value gets remapped to 'PMC*
	src_value' followed by 'KEY* src_key'.	This will be how the new
	_keyed operators will function, and those should be written within
	a few days.

	* vtable.tbl, lib/Parrot/Vtable.pm, t/pmc/perlstring.t: Changed the
	format of vtable.tbl to get rid of the tab-dependence.	The format
	now looks roughly like this:

	init() # 'void' and 'unique' are assumed INTVAL type ( ) # 'unique'
	is assumed str void concatenate (PMC* value, PMC* dest) # Nothing
	assumed here, but note the C-like prototyping.	Also had to disable
	one test that depended upon 'concat_p_p_s', which isn't necessary
	anyway.

	Vtable.pm will change again when the type '_keyed' is added,
	because that requires remapping parameters slightly differently
	again.	Also, note that it assumes 'value' is the first parameter
	in the list. This assumption will go away at the same time.

	Moving the internal KEY structure from the cache.struct_val member,
	where it doesn't really belong, to the internal SELF->data member.
	This frees up the cache/type members for other usage.

	This is the first step in moving PMCs to the point where we can do
	multidimensional PMC handles. The next step is to change the
	assembler to accept the syntax of 'set P0["foo"],7'.

	* jit2h.pl, lib/Parrot/Op.pm, lib/Parrot/OpsFile.pm: Added
	Op::may_jump boolean method.

	change the control flow.

	* Configure.pl, MANIFEST, testparrotfuncptr.c: This patch allows
	parrot to mostly-build with tcc.  It allows one to skip compiling
	the JIT stuff (by specifying --define jitcapable=0), and it
	introduces a test program which gives a friendlier error in this
	case for compilers which are as picky as tcc is about function
	pointer conversion.

	If anyone figures out the proper way to cast these function
	pointers this may not be necessary.

	documentation of a few more things.) And also a speling fiks
	s/POST_MORTERM/POST_MORTEM/.

	wanted to set the executable flag in CVS on assemble.pl,
	optimize.pl, etc.

	    Change Parrot::Test so it uses Test::Builder instead of Evil

	    output_* now returns whether the test passes or fails

	    Parrot::Test no longer exports Test::More's functions.  Instead
	they

	Test::More
	    features (ie. skip) have 'use Test::More' added.

	    I ditched the export_to_level() crutch.  Do we expect parrot to

	lib/Parrot/OpTrans/C.pm, lib/Parrot/OpTrans/CGoto.pm,
	lib/Parrot/OpTrans/CPrederef.pm, chartypes/unicode.c,
	chartypes/usascii.c: This patch adds a few more macros for .ops
	files to use. In addition to the existing

	 goto OFFSET(...)
	 goto ADDRESS(...)
	 goto POP()
	 goto NEXT()

	it adds

	 expr OFFSET(...)
	 expr ADDRESS(...)
	 expr POP()
	 expr NEXT()

	This is intended mainly for use in helper functions in .ops files,
	but also for ops that need to eg push the address of the next
	opcode onto a stack. The only place this currently happens (outside
	of my private code) is in the bsr opcode, which previously
	hardcoded the computation.

	This patch also makes ops2c.pl move the CUR_OPCODE #define a bit
	higher in the generated file so that it can be used by static
	functions in the preamble.

	Finally, I ran into a parentheses matching problem -- should goto
	OFFSET(...) rewrite    \bgoto\s+OFFSET\((.*)\) or
	\bgoto\s+OFFSET\((.*?)\)

	It was done inconsistently for the different calculations, and of
	course neither are correct because you really want matching
	parentheses. But that seems like too much bother. (Currently,
	there's only one place that uses anything other than $n in the
	parentheses, and that's the enternative() op.) So I made them all
	.*? but emulated recent POD by also allowing (( ... )) (that's two
	parenthesis with a space padding the body.)

	The generated core_ops.c and core_ops_prederef.c files after this
	patch are identical except for the CUR_OPCODE and REL_PC macros
	getting moved a little higher, and the bsr in the regular path (not
	prederef) uses 'CUR_OPCODE' instead of the hardcoded 'cur_opcode'.

	In summary, this is a big wad of meaningless changes for the
	current code. But it will make adding some opcodes easier in the
	future, and cleans up a small nit in the current bsr.

	level-4 warnings for 'unreferenced formal parameter' and 'named
	type definition in parentheses', the latter of which was turning up
	warnings in MS VC headers.  Level 4 warnings also helped me find a
	couple of other lurking bugs in the parrot code.

	Replaces the various fprintf/exit combos with calls to
	internal_exception, which uses var_args to emulate printf. Various
	exception types were added as well. These are probably temporary
	until a real exception system arrives.

	Fixed some places in the IO code where wrong functions were being
	called, or put into the vtable.

	* Configure.pl, Makefile.in: It adds a prompt to Configure asking
	for a list of opcode files to use.  The default is everything
	available except for obscure.ops.

	In addition, it makes it so that if your answer to a question
	starts with '+', it will concatenate it to the default.  For
	example:

	What C compiler do you want to use? [cl] +HAHAHA!!!

	will result in $PConfig{cc} eq "cl HAHAHA!!!".	While that example
	is not terribly useful, it is quite useful with things like
	command-line flags and the like.

	Finally, it contains a couple tweaks so that my syntax-highlighting
	editor recognizes some heredocs correctly.  :^)

	* Makefile.in:
	'make' no longer builds the mops test. Use 'make mops' for that. To
	run the test, you can do 'make mopstest'.

2001-12-30 17:30  gregor

	* Makefile.in:
	Fixed one oversight. 'make clean' was removing Parrot/Types.pm. Bad
	Gregor.

2001-12-30 17:26  gregor

	* .cvsignore, Configure.pl, Makefile.in, VERSION, config_h.in,
	core.ops, interpreter.c, make_vtable_ops.pl, obscure.ops, ops2c.pl,
	Parrot/BuildUtil.pm, Parrot/OpsFile.pm, lib/Parrot/BuildUtil.pm,
	lib/Parrot/OpsFile.pm, include/parrot/oplib.h:
	Build enhancements. Originally to support building shared
	libraries, but now of broader impact.

	  * .cvsignore: Ignore the blib/ directory, about which more later.

	  * Configure.pl:

	      * Got rid of TAB formatting and lined a few things up.

	      * Added header comment with CVS Id variable, and a few other
		block header comments.

	      * Uses new Parrot::BuildUtil module to determine the Parrot
		version.

	      * Reworded a few messages, added a couple, and wrapped
	messages
		to 79 columns.

	      * Added 2002 to the Copyright statement.

	      * Added new configure variables: VERSION, MAJOR, MINOR and
	PATCH

	      NOTE: Please see the 'Alas perl5.7.2' comment. 5.7.2 is
	greater
	      than 5.6.0, but the comment implies it isn't.

	  * Makefile.in:

	      * Added $(SO), $(A) and $(AR_CRS) defines for library
	building.

	      * Added $(RM_RF) define for removing directory trees

	      * Grouped generated files into two classes: "sticky" (made by
	configure,
		persisting across 'make clean') and 'fluid' (made during
	the build
		process, deleted by 'make clean').

	      * Added header comments.

	      * Added target for test_prog linked with shared library.

	      * Added rules to build shared libraries in blib/lib. The
	libraries are
		built with trailing version numbers in their file names,
	and then
		symbolic links are created for shorter and no version tag
	variants.

	      * Added some missing dependencies

	      * Added some missing 'make clean' targets.

	      * Added 'make realclean' target that deletes files created by
		Configure.pl (including Makefile), forcing a re-configure.

	      * Added a 'status' CVS target.

	  * VERSION: New file, contains only the version. This version
	number is
	    propagated to a few places, such as the core oplib version
	number. This
	    reduces the amount of coordination that has to happen to get
	version
	    number stuff throughout the tree in sync and updated prior to
	cutting
	    a new release. Feel free to grep for '0.0.3' to see the other
	files
	    that contain the version number (but, do that in a fresh CVS
	copy, or
	    after doing 'make realclean').

	  * config_h.in: Renamed PARROT_CORE_OPLIB_*_VERSION to
	PARROT_*_VERSION,
	    since the oplib and Parrot itself share a version number now.
	Added
	    PARROT_PATCH_VERSION (the third component) and PARROT_VERSION
	(a
	    string).

	  * core.ops: Uses new notation "VERSION = PARROT_VERSION" instead
	of
	    specifying the version by hand. Non-core oplibs will set this
	to
	    a quoted dot-string with three natural number components
	without
	    leading zeros.

	  * interpreter.c: Make use of PARROT_VERSION to simplify some
	sprintf()s, and
	    to get the complete version number in the resulting strings
	(including the
	    new PATCH portion).

	  * make_vtable_ops.pl: Put the "VERSION = PARROT_VERSION" line int
	the
	    generated file.

	  * obscure.ops: Use the new "VERSION = PARROT_VERSION" technique.

	  * ops2c.pl: Account for the PATCH version, too. This affects the
	name of the
	    oplib init function, and the oplib info struct initializer.

	  * Parrot/BuildUtil.pm: New file for reading in and validating the
	contents of
	    the new VERSION file. Other build utilities could go here in
	futuer.

	  * Parrot/OpsFile.pm:

	      * Allow three components in version number, and require that
	the value
		be in double quotes.

	      * Allow "VERSION = PARROT_VERSION", substituting the shared
	Parrot
		VERSION in that case.

	  * include/parrot/oplib.h: Add the patch_version member.

	vtables appropriately.	Also tests for same, new pmc_perlstring.t
	to hold tests specific to PerlStrings, as the pmc.t file is taking
	too long to run and slowing down my thought processes.

	Changes to strings.c etc to take string functions.

	Some changes to the strings docs, but not yet complete.

	Also, PerlString was copying pointers to strings, rather than
	strings themselves, so some action-at-a-distance bugs were creeping
	in, I think I've fixed this so everything works nicely.

	The unicode chartype has only had placeholders added for get_digit,
	string_to_num has been updated to use type->get_digit rather than
	the previous ascii-isms.  Some remain, but we need to carefully

	Initial code for dynamic loading of oplibs, applied for now to the
	loading of the core_prederef oplib when the -P flag is passed to
	test_parrot.

	  * MANIFEST: Added entry for the new file include/parrot/oplib.h.

	  * Makefile.in:

	      * Added libcore_prederef_0_3.so to the shared target.
	      * Added build rule for libcore_prederef_0_3.so.
	      * Added dependencies on Parrot/OpsFile.pm and Parrot/Op.pm
		to Parrot/OpLib/core.pm, core_ops.c and
		core_ops_prederef.c.

	  * config_h.in: Added defines for constants used to locate the
	    core oplib's init function, and the core_prederef oplib for
	    dynaloading.

	  * core.ops: Added a VERSION = 0.3 line near the top. This is now
	    required by Parrot/OpsFile.pm.

	  * interpreter.c:

	      * Added init_prederef() and stop_prederef() functions to load
		and unload the core_prederef oplib when we are in prederef
		mode.

		NOTE: In all likelihood, the prederef stuff has a rapidly
		dwindling time-to-live. The JIT should provide vastly
	superior
		performance, and loading an alternate set of core_ops isn't
		the real direction for the dynaloading stuff. Loading
		*additional* ops is. It does provide a handy test case for
	the
		general idea for now, though.

	      * Gets the core copcode table, etc. via the core oplibs oplib
		info pointer, as returned by the core oplib's init
	function.

	  * ops2c.pl

	      * Make use of the version, major version and minor version
		stuff parsed by Parrot/OpsFile.pm

	      * The only exported symbol in the generated files is the init
		function now, since that returns an oplib info struct
		pointer, and all the important stuff can be found there.

	  * ops2pm.pl: Put the oplib version in the generated .pm file.

	  * test_main.c: Small changes necessitated by changes in the names
	    of some members of the interpreter struct.

	  * trace.c: Small changes necessitated by changes in the names
	    of some members of the interpreter struct.

	  * Parrot/OpsFile.pm: Require a "VERSION = x.y" line before any
	    ops are found.

	  * include/parrot/interp_guts.h: Small changes necessitated by
	    changes in the names of some members of the interpreter struct.

	  * include/parrot/interpreter.h: Include the new
	    include/parrot/oplib.h header. Small changes to the oplib-
	    related members.

	  * include/parrot/oplib.h: Define the type of the oplib init
	    function, and the struct type for the oplib info.

	  * platforms/*.[hc]: Remove the second argument to Parrot_dlopen()
	    since not all platforms have it. For those that do, a default
	    second argument is provided.

	Some more JIT work from Daniel Grunblatt.

	  * Ops added set_s_s, set_s_sc, bsr_i and eq_s_sc but using calls
	to C
	    functions.

	  * Added JUMP(END) to place the number of bytes to the end of the
	current
	    op.

	  * The *.jit files syntax changed.

	  * Added jit/i386/lib.jit to place handly functions as jump that
	take as
	    argument the address where is the opcode number to jump to.

	  * There is a bug at some point, but I will start writing
	    jit/i386/string.jit and jit/i386/stacks.jit so that we don't
	have use
	    calls, which make the jit as slow as the interpreter.

	Changes to syntax of .ops files and refactoring of ops2c*.pl and
	pbc2c.pl.

	  * Removed ops2c-prederef.pl

	  * (unrelated) Removed vestigial Parrot/Opcode.pm file.

	  * Added Parrot/OpTrans.pm, Parrot/OpTrans/C.pm (needed for old
	    functionality of ops2c.pl), Parrot/OpTrans/CPrederef.pm (needed
	    for old functionality of ops2c-prederef.pl), and
	    Parrot/OpTrans/CGoto.pm (needed for functionality of pbc2c.pl).

	    "OpTrans" == "Op Transformation"

	  * Makefile.in modifications to call "ops2c.pl C" where it used
	    to be just "ops2c.pl", and "ops2c.pl CPrederef" where it used
	    to be "ops2c-prederef.pl".

	  * core.ops and obscure.ops changes to syntax. Semantics are
	    identical with previous version:

	      return HALT	  -->  HALT()
	      return AUTO	  -->  goto NEXT()
	      return RETREL(...)  -->  goto OFFSET(...)
	      return RESTART(*)   -->  restart NEXT()

	    Also, pop_generic_entry() stuff (local var + 5 lines of code)
	    for dest-less branch ops replaced with new notation "goto
	POP()",
	    which uses the new pop_dest() function in stacks.c. This also
	    allowed these ops to become 'inline' ops, since they no longer
	    have local variables.

	    The 'ret' op also became simplified to just "goto POP()", and
	    also became an inline op.

	  * interpreter.c reflects the change in type name:

	      prederef_op_func_t   -->	op_func_prederef_t

	    that occurred in include/parrot/op.h

	  * make_vtable_ops.pl uses "goto NEXT()" where it used to use
	    "return AUTO".

	  * ops2c.pl is now generic. Its first argument is the last
	    package name component of a subclass of Parrot::OpTrans. These
	    subclasses all have full names of the form Parrot::OpTrans::*.
	    An instance of the class is created and later consulted for
	    various bits of information needed to generate the C code.

	  * pbc2c.pl now uses an instance of Parrot::OpTrans::CGoto to
	    contain its transformation rules.

	  * stacks.c has a new function pop_dest() that pops a destination
	    off the control stack. include/parrot/stacks.h has the
	prototype.

	  * Parrot/Op.pm now supports the syntax generated by
	Parrot::OpsFile
	    for the "goto POP" case.

	    Also, the source() method now expects its second argument to be
	    an object that ISA Parrot::OpTrans. Methods of this object are
	    called to perform the substitutions.

	  * Parrot/OpsFile.pm supports the change in notation mentioned
	    above.

	  * docs/intro.pod reflects these changes.

	  * include/parrot/op.h: Renamed type prederef_op_func_t to
	    op_func_prederef_t because it made the implementation of the
	    shared ops2c.pl easier.

	* Configure.pl, config_h.in, interpreter.c, test_main.c:
	Both test_parrot (via test_main.c) and the intepreter itself (via

	    format for printing floating-point numbers.

	  * New, improved *.jit syntax for references to registers,
	    e.g. INT_REG[n].

	  * Support for C() improved.

	* Configure.pl, Makefile.in, jit2h.pl:
	Attempt to fix Win32 builds.

	  * No more empty braces in include/parrot/jit_struct.h

	* MANIFEST, core.ops, t/op/key.t: MANIFEST - Removed t/op/key.t
	core.ops - Removed key operators, they should be hidden from the
	assembler.  t/op/key.t - No need to test the nonexistent key
	operators.

2001-12-20 00:13  ajgough

	* core.ops, t/op/stacks.t: Added tests for entrytype op, noticed
	that asking for type of entry at depth causes segfault as stack is
	zero based, fixed cmp in core.ops to reflect this.  Last test is
	skipped as we don't do exceptions right yet.

2001-12-19 19:11  ajgough

	* t/op/debuginfo.t: Added C<end> ops to debuginfo.t, as thier

	addition of the clone operator.

2001-12-18 20:06  gregor

	* interpreter.c, include/parrot/interp_guts.h:
	Performance improvements to the predereferencing code path
	suggested to me over lunch yesterday by my friend John Kennedy.
	The goal is to remove the additional test in the inner loop that
	was checking for NULL to decide whether or not to call the
	prederef() function. Also moved pc & pc_prederef syncing outside
	the inner loop.

	  * Changed the prototype of the prederef() function in
	    interpreter.c to match that of an opfunc.

	  * Instead of initializing the prederef void * array with NULL,
	    we initialize it with pointers to prederef().

	  * prederef() now returns the prederef_pc passed in, so that
	    after predereferencing, the same location is executed, but now
	    with the real code being called.

	Thanks to: John Kennedy

2001-12-18 19:59  ajgough

	Improved the method of calling the assembler.

2001-12-13 13:30  gregor

	* languages/jako/Makefile.in:
	Improve the build process. It now works from the main parrot dir,

	Makefile.in.

2001-12-13 13:29  gregor

	* languages/jako/.cvsignore:
	Ignore the (now generated Makefile), and don't ignore .list files

	Added a 'languages' target to the top-level Makefile.in, and
	modified the jako build procedure to involve Makefile.in -->
	Makefile too (done by Configure.pl).

	NOTE: languages/jako and language/scheme are built.
	languages/miniperl wasn't building right, so it was left off for

	* .cvsignore, MANIFEST, Makefile.in, core.ops, interpreter.c,
	ops2c-prederef.pl, ops2c.pl, test_main.c,
	include/parrot/interp_guts.h, include/parrot/interpreter.h,
	include/parrot/op.h, include/parrot/oplib/.cvsignore:
	Welcome to the Just-in-Time Predereferencing Patch!

	This patch implements a "predereferencing" mode for parrot. That
	means that a lot of the dereferencing you see in DO_OP and in the
	opfuncs is done up front (really, JIT) rather than as and each time
	we execute each op in the byte code stream.

	This works by creating an array of void pointers with the same
	number of elements as the byte code array. This array starts out
	life zero-initialized.	Each time we go to execute an op, we check
	first to see if we have a NULL pointer at *cur_opcode. If so, we
	know we haven't done our predereferencing yet (this is the JIT
	part), so we call the prederef() function with sufficient args that
	it can go look up opfunc pointers and op arg types and put the
	opfunc and arg pointers at cur_opcode[0] .. cur_opcode[N - 1],
	where N is the number of args (counting the op itself as one arg).

	We assume that sizeof(INTVAL) <= sizeof(void *), so we can continue
	to have inline INTVAL constants.

	I've been getting about a 22% speed increase over vanilla code path
	when I compile with -O0. Advantage decreases at -O9 here. I tested
	with mops.pbc, and also by temporarily putting the -P flag in
	Parrot/Test.pm and running all the tests. So, this code is as
	correct as the test suite can detect.

	Here's how it plays out in the code:

	  * New script ops2c-prederef.pl

	    Copy-paste code reuse from ops2c.pl. Modified to expect the
	args to give
	    a void ** cur_opcode and to return a void **.

	  * Modified ops2c.pl

	      * opfuncs are now static. Who needs to call them by name from
	outside,
		anyway? They are accessed via the opfunc table.

	      * Some MACRO stuff to make things work whether we prederef or
	not. It
		may be possible to get rid of these some day if other folks
	agree
		that we should be using CODE object pointers + offsets as
	our PC
		rather than raw pointers to either opcode_t's or (void *)'s
		(depending on prederef mode or no).

	  * core.ops modified to be usable to build both kinds of opfuncs.
	For now,
	    this means:

	      * calls to push_generic_entry(... cur_opcode ...) were
	changed to
		push_generic_entry(... CUR_OPCODE ...), where CUR_OPCODE is
	a
		macro that does the right thing in both kinds of ops.c
	files.

		This is applicable to the bsr op. If we treated
	destinations as
		(Code PMC + local offset) rather than as
	pointer-to-memory-somewhere,
		this wouldn't be a big deal. We may need to do that at some
	point
		anyway, so that when you jump around and return not only do
	you have
		the right PC (pointer, today), but you also have the
	thread/interpreter
		knowing what chunk of bytecode it is in at all times
	(assuming we'll
		allow reflection, as in ops that query or affect the
	current CODE PMC).

	      * runinterp was modified. Instead of copying the top-level
	PackFile struct
		and blasting its byte_code pointer, we simply call runops
	on the new
		interp, passing in the pointer to the current interp's code
	and the
		offset into that code at which to start (this last arg used
	to be a
		pointer PC, now its an offset PC).

	  * include/parrot/op.h

	      * new typedef for prederef opfuncs (they return void **)

	  * include/parrot/interp_guts.h

	      * New DO_OP_PREDEREF() macro described above.

	  * include/parrot/interpreter.h

	      * New prototype of runops() -- see below.

	      * resume_addr field changed to resume_flag and resume_offset
	pair of fields.
		We might be resuming from interp using prederef to one not
	or vice-versa,
		so pointers between the two don't play nice together.
	Offsets are beautiful.

	      * New PARROT_PREDEREF_FLAG constant

	  * interpreter.c

	      * include "parrot/oplib/core_ops_prederef.h"

	      * prederef() function described above.

	      * runops_prederef() runops variant. Uses DO_OP_PREDEREF()
	macro as its core.

	      * runops() modified to take size_t CODE-relative offset PC
	rather than
		pointer PC. This made other things workable and doesn't
	seem to have lost
		anything important (IMO).

	  * test_main.c

	      * New flag '-P' to enable predereferencing.

	  * Makefile modified to build core_ops_prederef.c from core.ops
	via
	    ops2c-prederef.pl.

	    BTW, also added missing $(INC)/interp_guts.h to H_FILES.

	    Added core_ops_prederef$(O) to O_FILES

	* make.pl: Added make.pl

2001-12-13 02:44  jgoff

	* languages/miniperl/Miniperl.pm: Nearly-complete 'make'
	replacement in perl.  Non-compliant bits - Takes absolutely -NO-
	special flags...		     - Dies on undefined macros
	such as $(PDISASM) in current make		       - Dies on
	recursive macro expansions			 (Doesn't test for
	mutual or multipart loops)		       - In general it
	seems to be a little less lenient...  Missing bits - File
	mod/creation times aren't being looked at	       - Actions
	aren't being taken		- The few funky variables ($@, $<)
	aren't being dealt with Bugs - Line numbers are slipping a bit.

2001-12-12 16:17  jgoff

	* languages/miniperl/: Makefile, Miniperl.pm, foo.mpl, miniperlc,
	mpc: Final go-round, hopefully.

	languages/miniperl/Makefile - Used basically to run tests, as there

	generalized set_element_value and element_value 	to accept
	KEY_PAIRs from core.ops include/parrot/key.h - Modified header.
	core.ops - Modified to accept the new return style.

	This is a prelude to adding virtual-table methods to allow hashing
	&c. Expect at least one or two more redesigns before this settles
	down. However, it still passes the original tests.

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.in, classes/Makefile.in, classes/default.pmc,
	classes/perlnum.pmc, classes/pmc2c.pl:
	Add "default" PMC vtable so you can inherit implied stuff.

2001-12-08 21:24  simon

	* Parrot/PackFile.pm, docs/parrot.pod, docs/parrotbyte.pod,
	docs/vtables.pod, lib/Parrot/PackFile.pm:
	Getting the documentation up to scratch.

2001-12-08 21:21  simon

	* classes/pmc2c.pl:
	Allow inheriting from default class.

2001-12-07 20:43  gregor

	* examples/assembly/queens.pasm:
	Regenerated the file with the latest jakoc.

2001-12-07 20:29  simon

	Rename "rotate" to "rotate_up".

2001-12-07 20:15  simon

	* t/op/stacks.t:
	Some tests for rotate.

2001-12-07 00:55  gregor

	* core.ops:
	Cast the result of the pointer arithmetic, since without the cast
	there are warnings with some compilers, and without the parens
	around the pointer arithmetic, precedence breaks the meaning and
	causes crashes.

2001-12-06 23:37  simon

	* core.ops:
	Temporary. I prefer compiler warnings to segfaults, thanks.

2001-12-06 23:34  simon

	* runops_cores.c:
	Make "trace" work again.

2001-12-06 21:23  dan

	lib/Parrot/Test.pm: Fix up source issues that made Dec C unhappy

2001-12-06 19:22  simon

	* core.ops:
	Yet another "How the *%$! did that compile?" moment.

2001-12-06 18:28  dan

	* hints/vms.pl: Fix to build, with a HERE logical required

2001-12-06 17:48  dan

	* core.ops, interpreter.c, pbc2c.pl, pdump.c, test_main.c,
	docs/parrot_assembly.pod, include/parrot/interpreter.h: Sensible
	changes to the interpreter--flags are now part of the interp
	structure.

2001-12-06 00:11  tom

	* string.c, chartypes/unicode.c, chartypes/usascii.c,
	encodings/singlebyte.c, encodings/utf16.c, encodings/utf8.c,
	include/parrot/chartype.h, include/parrot/encoding.h,
	include/parrot/parrot.h: Moved string to number conversion code out
	of the encoding layer and into the main string layer as neither the
	encoding layer nor the character type layer knows enough on it's
	own to do the conversion correctly.

2001-12-05 23:12  tom

	* Makefile.in: Rebuild the classes directory if any of the object
	files for the classes are missing rather than only when perlint.o
	is missing.

2001-12-05 19:43  gregor

	* Parrot/Assembler.pm, lib/Parrot/Assembler.pm:
	  * Reworked the constantize_string() stuff a little bit because it
	was
	    puking on things like "\033[H\033[2J\0" (which occurs in the
	    languages/jako/mandelzoom.jako example).

2001-12-05 19:39  gregor

2001-12-05 17:19  gregor

	* pbc2c.pl:
	  * Reverted recent changes, since they broke the script. Real fix
	coming
	    later.

2001-12-05 17:03  simon

	* classes/Makefile.in:
	Remember: change Makefile.in, not Makefile. D'oh.

2001-12-05 17:02  simon

	* Makefile.in:
	Ensure PMC.pm gets remade.

2001-12-05 16:58  simon

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.in, classes/Makefile.in,
	classes/perlundef.pmc, include/parrot/pmc.h:

	* MANIFEST: Added t/op/pmc.t to MANIFEST.

2001-12-04 05:02  ajgough

	* classes/perlnum.pmc: Picky compiler pointed out probable thinko
	in perlnum.c

2001-12-04 04:24  ajgough

	* encodings/singlebyte.c, t/op/pmc.t, t/pmc/pmc.t: A much less
	broken form of strtod and appropriate tests.  Does not yet check
	for overflow.

2001-12-04 01:31  ajgough

	* string.c, encodings/singlebyte.c, encodings/utf16.c,
	encodings/utf8.c, include/parrot/encoding.h: Added length parameter
	to extract_num and extract_int string vtables, without this it
	would be impossible to have strings with nulls in while still
	knowing where they ended.

2001-12-03 18:40  ajgough

	* string.c, classes/perlstring.pmc, encodings/singlebyte.c,
	encodings/utf16.c, encodings/utf8.c, include/parrot/encoding.h,

	* classes/Makefile.in: Removed some redundant targets.

2001-12-02 19:02  ajgough

	* t/: op/pmc.t, pmc/pmc.t: Modified all pmc tests to make use of fp
	equality macro rather than using perl to generate expected output,
	all tests now have <<OUTPUT.

2001-12-02 17:44  ajgough

	* t/op/trans.t: Upgraded fp_eq and fp_ne macros to be more useful
	for pmc.t as well.  Will probably move macros into another file at
	some point, although this might be best left until the tests are
	unperled.

2001-12-02 06:16  jgoff

	* classes/pmc2c.pl: It wasn't properly setting the vtable index
	within Parrot_Perl{Class}_init.

2001-12-02 06:09  jgoff

	* classes/Makefile.in: I seem to have removed *$(O) twice..

	- Removed classes/ build stuff, replaced with classes/Makefile.in
		    Added '-I./include' locally docs/Makefile - Should no
	longer be used, but I'm not brave enough to do a
	cvs delete.

2001-12-02 01:21  ajgough

	* t/op/trans.t: Refactored trans math tests to have hard coded
	expected return values and be more ready to be unperled at some
	point in the future.  Added $fp_equality_macro which is a
	"nearly-equal-to" function.

2001-12-02 01:18  ajgough

	* Makefile.in: Humph.  People really ought to use Makefile
	variables, s/perl/$(PERL)/ throughout.

2001-12-01 18:15  jgoff

	* classes/: perlint.pmc, perlnum.pmc: Temporary patch until we
	figure out what to do vis-a-vis the lack of snprintf.

2001-11-30 06:20  jgoff

	* classes/: perlint.pmc, perlnum.pmc, perlstring.pmc:
	classes/perlint.pmc - Fixes and expanding for concat and math with
	strings classes/perlnum.pmc - Fixes and expanding for concat and
	math with strings classes/perlstring.pmc - Fixes and expanding for
	concat and math with strings

2001-11-29 15:21  ajgough

	* hints/os2.pl: This is a hints file for os/2, I've set $c{perl} as
	$^X lies, which confused bash which make uses to run things when
	doing its stuff.

2001-11-29 04:58  jgoff

	* classes/perlstring.pmc: Removed C++-style comments for good
	measure

	A little code tidiness.

2001-11-15 19:33  simon

	user-defined PMC flags.

	starting with _ are reserved to implementors by the C standard.

	Also fixed string_index to use the encoding routines instead of
	assuming a single byte encoding.

2001-11-13 12:59  jgoff

	test was failing. Nothing to do with ord().

	string_concat to handle null strings properly.	docs/strings.pod -
	Description of string_ord include/parrot/exceptions.h - Added
	ORD_OUT_OF_STRING exception include/parrot/string.h - Added
	string_ord() t/op/string.t - Added full set of test for
	ord_i_(s|sc)(_(i|ic))?

	string.c contains a bit of documentation explaining the logic
	behind _string_index, primarily having to do with multiple encoding
	formats.

	* Configure.pl, MANIFEST, Makefile.in, core.ops,
	platforms/generic.c, platforms/generic.h: Made things a bit more

	include/parrot/parrot.h, platforms/linux.c, platforms/linux.h,
	platforms/win32.c, platforms/win32.h:
	Patch from Jason Diamond to make win32 platform stuff work:

	* Modified Configure.pl, mswin32.pl, and Makefile.in so that the
	platform specific files in the platforms directory gets copied to
	the correct directories. The Makefile will re-copy the platform.h
	and .c files if the original is modified.

	* #include platform.h in parrot.h instead of time.h.

	* Removed time.h and time.obj from the Makefile. time.h and time.c
	aren't being used anymore since that code was moved to linux.c and
	win32.c.

	* Renamed the BOOL typedef in parrot.h to BOOLVAL (inspired by
	INTVAL and FLOATVAL). This was conflicting with the BOOL typedef in
	windows.h. This required updating several files besides parrot.h.

	* Added a DEFAULT_OPEN_MODE to linux.h and win32.h and used that
	instead of the missing identifiers (on Windows) in core.ops in the
	calls to open.

	* Added Parrot_sleep and Parrot_setenv to both the linux and win32
	platform files and called those from core.ops. The Linux code for
	these functions came from core.ops so they should hopefully work.

	  * time.c and include/parrot/time.h

	    First attempt at getting this working across platforms. The
	    macro WIN32 being tested might not be right.

	  * New functions Parrot_intval_time() and Parrot_floatval_time()
	    wrap the appropriate functionality depending upon platform.
	    Changed core.ops to call these.

	Added obscure.ops with obscure transcendental ops.

	Added simple file I/O ops (close, open, read, write):

	  * Initial versions Courtesy of Jeff <jgoff@speakeasy.net>

	  * I changed some arg ordering stuff.

	  * I added read/write of INTVALs and FLOATVALs.

	Added environment variable ops (getenv, setenv)

	Added system error ops (err(i) and err(s) for accessing errno and
	strerr().

	Moved print ops in with other "temporary" developer ops, since
	they'll move to a devel.ops or temp.ops oplib once we have oplibs.

2001-10-29 14:37  gregor

	* core.ops, languages/jako/jakoc:
	  * New variants of the save ops to save constants on the stack.
	This is
	    useful for saving zero arg and result counts on the stack, for
	example.

	  * Modified jakoc to to adapt to the newly announced calling
	conventions.
	    Even though Jako source code appears to show subroutines with
	fixed
	    numbers of arguments and results, they are implemented with the
	    variable count calling convention. Future modifications will be
	needed
	    to ensure that an exception is raised if the stack frame is of
	the
	    wrong size (or, at least that we pop the complete frame off).
	We'll
	    also have to make more changes to support the true
	fixed-arg-count
	    and fixed-result-count parts of the calling convention spec.

	Initial work on PMCs. Explanation to follow

2001-10-21 15:20  gregor

	* examples/assembly/queens.pasm:
	  * Modernize the calling conventions in queens.pasm. It was using
	swap,
	    which now must be rotate. Also, changed to use return values on
	the
	    stack instead of in I0.

2001-10-19 18:14  gregor

	* core.ops, stacks.c, include/parrot/stacks.h,
	languages/jako/jakoc:
	Per Dan's request, replacing 'swap' op by 'rotate'.

	  * core.ops: Replaced 'swap()' by 'rotate(i|ic)'.

	  * stacks.c and stacks.h: Removed swap-related functions from my
	    prior commit, replacing them with stack_depth(), stack_entry()
	    and rotate_entries().

	    NOTE: The stack_depth() and rotate_entries() routines could
	    be made more efficient through the caching of the sum of chunk
	    'used' members from lower chunks in a field in the upper
	    chunks. Also, if the interpreter's stack_base was changed to
	    hold the pointer to the *top* chunk (since we usually come
	    at the stack from the top down) instead of the *bottom*
	    chunk. The code here at least works, and we can decide about
	    bigger changes separately.

	    For now, rotate only handles rotates in one direction and
	    of magnituded one. A fully general rotate would do handle
	    rotates in both directions and of arbitrary amounts. Again,
	    this implementation is sufficient for current applications,
	    and a feature-complete version can be developed if this turns
	    out to be otherwise the right type of implementation.

	    This change includes a new exception for ERROR_STACK_SHALLOW,
	    meaning "not-empty-yet-not-deep-enough-for-what-you-asked".

	  * jakoc: Changed the calling convention to use rotate instead
	    of swap (of course). Also changed the convention for return
	    value passing to use the stack as well.

2001-10-19 13:36  gregor

	* MANIFEST, core.ops, disassemble.pl, stacks.c,
	examples/assembly/queens.pasm, include/parrot/stacks.h,
	languages/jako/.cvsignore, languages/jako/Makefile,
	languages/jako/bench.jako, languages/jako/euclid.jako,
	languages/jako/fact.jako, languages/jako/jakoc,
	languages/jako/mandelbrot.jako, languages/jako/mops.jako,
	languages/jako/primes.jako, languages/jako/queens.jako,
	languages/jako/sub.jako:
	  * New stack functions push_entry(), pop_entry() and swap_entry().
	    The first two exist for the support of the last one. These
	    functions don't care what is in the stack entries. These exist
	    to support the new 'swap' op (see next bullet).

	  * New op 'swap' for swapping the top two elements on the stack.
	    This is necessary for passing arguments to functions, since
	    the return address will be on top of any arguments that have
	    been pushed on the stack. This way, you can use a (swap, pop)
	    pair to retrieve each argument (for subroutine linkage).

	  * Disassembler now prints numbers in decimal by default, with
	    a new '-x' flag to turn on hexadecimal display. Since other
	    members of the Parrot Tool Set use decimal by default, this
	    makes it easier to compare output from the various tools.

	  * Jako compiler has more explanatory comments and the following
	    new features:

	      * Lexically scoped variables.

	      * Subroutines that take arguments and return values:

		  sub int foo(int bar) {
		    if (bar == 1) {
		      return 42;
		    } else {
		      return 13;
		    }
		  }
	      * ... if (...) and ... unless (...) statement modifiers
		can be used on next, last and redo.

	      * Bitwise and (&, &=) and or (|, |=) ops.

	      * Type names are just 'int', 'num', 'str', and 'poly' now.
		The old long names 'integer', 'number', 'string', and
		'polytype' are no longer valid.

	      * Integer variable assignments can now use 0b (binary),
		0 (octal) and 0x (hexadecimal) radix prefixes on literals.

	  * New Jako and Parrot assembly examples queens.{jako,pasm} for
	    solving the eight-queens problem. The assembly example is a
	    hand-modified version of the assembly code produced by the
	    Jako compiler from queens.jako. A few unnecessary ops have
	    been removed, lots of unnecessary labels have been removed,
	    and all the Jako source code comments have been removed.

	  * Makefile and .cvsignore in languages/jako modified so that
	    the assembler produces listings when assembling the programs,
	    yet the *.list files are ignored by CVS.

	  * Made the default target in languages/jako/Makefile 'all'.

	  * Modified some of the Jako examples to use some of the new
	    features of Jako, such as subroutines and lexical variable
	    scoping.

	* runops_cores.c, include/parrot/runops_cores.h:

	* core.ops, Parrot/OpsFile.pm, docs/.cvsignore, docs/Makefile,
	lib/Parrot/OpsFile.pm: Integrated op documentation.

	  * core.ops now contains POD documentation of ops, interspersed
	with the
	    ops themselves

	  * Ops are organized into POD =head2 sections

	  * Parrot/OpsFile.pm now treats the preamble of the ops file as
	anything
	    up to the first POD directive OR op definition.

	  * docs/Makefile now generates core_ops.pod from core.ops vi
	perldoc -u.

	Moby Patch:

	  * basic_opcodes.ops and opcode_table replaced by core.ops

	  * process_opfunc.pl replaced by Parrot/OpsFile.pm, Parrot/Op.pm,
	    and ops2c.pl. These convert *.ops to *_ops.c and
	    include/parrot/oplib/*_ops.h

	  * New ops2pm.pl converts *.ops to Parrot/OpLib/*.pm

	  * disassemble.pl modified to use

	  * interpreter.c modified to use structures in core_ops.c instead
	    of the old op_info and op_func stuff. We're not yet to the
	    point of handling multiple oplibs at a time, but we are getting
	    there...

	    Fingerprinting stuff disabled for now. We used to go off
	    opcode_table. We need to rethink this. I have some ideas to
	    make it unnecessary, but it remains to be seen whether others
	    will like the direction they take us.

	    Termination condition for while(){} loop in runops is now
	    (pc) instead of (*pc). Any op can cause a HALT by returning
	    a NULL pointer. Ops end, bounds and trace all do this. So, now
	    the 'end' op body is actually executed, although all it does
	    is HALT.

	  * Makefile.in modified to perform a test build using pbc2c.pl,
	    which is the bytecode --> C compiler I've posted to the
	    list before.

	  * Op full names are now autogenerated. Op root names must not
	    contain underscores, so some op renamings have happened.
	    Such as clear_i becoming cleari.

	* basic_opcodes.ops:
	  * Fixed a couple of typos.

2001-10-08 14:45  gregor

	* basic_opcodes.ops, opcode_table, t/op/integer.t, t/op/number.t:
	Arithmetic enhancements:

	  * Renamed existing mod_i as cmod_i and added "corrected" mod_i:

	    NOTE: This "uncorrected mod" algorithm uses the C language's
	built-in
	    mod operator (x % y), which is

		... the remainder when x is divided by y, and thus is zero
	when y
		divides x exactly.
		...
		The direction of truncation for / and teh sign of the
	result for %
		are machine-dependent for negative operands, as is the
	action taken
		on overflow or underflow.
								     --
	[1], page 41

	    Also:

		... if the second operand is 0, the result is undefined.
	Otherwise, it
		is always true that (a/b)*b + a%b is equal to z. I both
	operands are
		non-negative, then teh remainder is non-negative and
	smaller than the
		divisor; if not, it is guaranteed only that the absolute
	value of the
		remainder is smaller than the absolute value of the
	divisor.
								     --
	[1], page 205

	    This op is provided for those who need it (such as
	speed-sensitive
	    applications with heavy use of mod, but using it only with
	positive
	    arguments), but a more mathematically useful numeric mod based
	on
	    floor(x/y) and defined with y == 0 is provided by the mod_i op.

	      [1] Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, *The C
	Programming
		  Language*, Second Edition. Prentice Hall, 1988.

	  * Added "corrected" mod_i:

	    NOTE: This "corrected mod" algorithm is based on the C code on
	page 70
	    of [1]. Assuming correct behavior of C's built-in mod operator
	(%) with
	    positive arguments, this algorithm implements a mathematically
	convenient
	    version of mod, defined thus:

	      x mod y = x - y * floor(x / y)

	    For more information on this definition of mod, see section 3.4
	of [2],
	    pages 81-85.

	*Concrete
		  Mathematics*, Second Edition. Addison-Wesley, 1994.

	  * Added mod_n, using the same formula as above, but with FLOATVAL
	    arguments.

	  * Added cmod_n, using the C math library's fmod() function:

	    NOTE: This "uncorrected mod" algorithm uses the built-in C math
	library's
	    fmod() function, which computes

		... the remainder of dividing x by y. The return value is x
	- n * y,
		where n is the quotient of x / y, rounded towards zero to
	an
		integer.
						-- fmod() manpage on RedHat
	Linux 7.0

	    In addition, fmod() returns

		the remainder, unless y is zero, when the function fails
	and errno
		is set.

	    According to page 251 of [1], the result when y is zero is
	implementation-
	    defined.

	    This op is provided for those who need it, but a more
	mathematically
	    useful numeric mod based on floor(x/y) instead of truncate(x/y)
	and
	    defined with y == 0 is provided by the mod_n op.

	      [1] Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, *The C
	Programming
		  Language*, Second Edition. Prentice Hall, 1988.

	  * Added and modified tests as appropriate for the above.

	* basic_opcodes.ops, interpreter.c, opcode_table,
	process_opfunc.pl, test_main.c, include/parrot/interpreter.h,
	t/trace.pasm:
	  * Two new ops, trace_ic and bounds_ic that twiddle bits in
	    interpreter->flags and set interpreter->resume_addr.

	  * Two new runops core variants, so now we cover the relevant
	    flag space over {trace, notrace} x {boundscheck, noboundscheck}

	  * Runops core selection that converts the flags into an index
	into
	    a core table (runops_cores) to get the core function pointer.

	  * A new trace_op variant that doesn't do bounds checking (used by
	    the non-bounds-checking-but-tracing runops core).

	  * PC is passed into the cores so that they can be used when
	    resuming (they used to assume starting at the beginning of the
	    code, which would thwart resumption).

	  * runops() itself is changed to have a while() loop in it so that
	    any time we drop out of the core, we'll resume if we have an
	    interpreter->resume_addr set (after reselecting the core,
	though).

	  * process_opfunc.pl has a new "macro": RESUME(), that sets up
	    interpreter->resume_addr. This is used by the new ops. The new
	    ops still return the new PC as the next op (which MUST be an
	    'end' op to force the core loop to terminate -- *pc being false
	    is the only termination condition we can count on for all
	cores).

	  * New interpreter flag: PARROT_BOUNDS_FLAG, used to control
	    bounds checking core selection.

	  * test_prog now has a '-b' flag in addition to the '-t' flag.
	Now,
	    bounds checking is off by default (I saw a performance boost:
	    6.3 Mop/s with -b, 7.0 Mop/s without).

	  * A new sample/test program: t/trace.pasm that twiddles the trace
	    flag while it is running.

	* .cvsignore, Makefile.in, build_interp_starter.pl, interpreter.c,
	include/parrot/.cvsignore, include/parrot/interpreter.h:
	Now that 0.0.2 is released, I can clear out the backlog of approved
	but uncommitted patches. Here's one Dan approved on 2001-09-21
	(Simplified DO_OP):

	  * test_prog and pdump are linked with only the files the need,
	not
	    al the files.

	  * build_interp_starter.pl writes out op_info.[hc], too. These
	files
	    contain op name, arg count and arg type information. This will
	be
	    useful for multiple things in the future, including better
	trace
	    output and the crystalizing loader.

	  * The DO_OP macro is now simpler and doesn't require explicit
	    temporaries.

	  * interpreter.c is modified to use the new op info in tracing
	output.

	  * The interpreter just points its opcode_funcs and opcode_info
	    members at the default tables rather than allocating memory on
	    the fly.

	memory.c, packfile.c, process_opfunc.pl, strnative.c, test_main.c:
	This patch ensures that all bytecode is of type opcode_t except for
	the constant table constants.  That means that almost all of the
	INTVALs in the code were replaced with opcode_t and the i pack type
	was replaced with the op pack type in calls to pack_arg and such.
	Also, since it has been declared that ALL integer constants are to
	be 32 bits, some test cases were changed to ensure that an integer
	constant was no bigger than 2 ** 31.

	process_opfunc.pl was also cleaned up to no longer look at either
	opcode_table or interp_guts.h but gather all of its information
	from Opcode.pm.

	The Assembler.pm module was changed to do late binding of arguments
	so that 0 could be treated like 0.0 without having to be so
	declared.  Also, only strings now use the [sc:N] intermediate form
	as it was unnecessary for integer and float types.

	    arithmetic expressions involving (global) labels, the current
	    instructions base address ('@'), numeric constants (not
	equates)
	    and basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, / -- although + and -
	    are likely to be the only ones used in practice).

	  * Fixed a bug in Parrot/Assemble.pl that caused macro expansion
	to
	    fail (argument passing wasn't working).

	  * Enabled t/op/basic.t's last test, which is actually a copy of
	the
	    code from t/call.pasm. Now all tests there are enabled and
	working.

	  * Added new example/test program t/call.pasm to demonstrate
	working
	    macros and poor-man's subroutine calls

	  * Added header comments to t/*.pasm

	lib/Parrot/PackFile/Constant.pm, lib/Parrot/PackFile/FixupTable.pm,
	include/parrot/packfile.h, include/parrot/string.h:
	Move NVs to the constant table.    * Changes to Types_pm.in to make
	life easier for some of the	 packing/etc. I'm doing elsewhere.
	Also, we now pack 'n' as      'i'.

	  * Moved the guts of assemble.pl to Parrot/Assembler.pm so that
	    eventually we can use all these tools together inside scripts
	    rather than call out to the shell to run the programs.

	  * As I was tracking down problems, I converted the internal
	    documentation of the assembler to POD from comments.

	  * Changed the numeric regexp in the assembler to detect leading
	    signs and trailing exponents.

	  * Updated basic_opcodes.ops to fetch numeric constants from the
	    constant table.

	  * Enhanced the disassembler in a number of ways to make my life
	    easier while tracking down bugs (try it out). It now puts in
	    labels for ops that are the destinations of flow control ops.

	  * packfile.c now has a TRACE_PACKFILE switch that can be set
	    to get it to print info as it processes. I needed this while
	    debugging, but I can remove it or change it before committing
	    if its a problem.

	  * Updated pdump.c because it was missing a call to init_world().

	  * Updated process_opfunc.pl to deal with numeric constants
	    being stored in the constant table instead of inline.

	  * Added multiple type support to Parrot/PackFile/Constant.pm

	  * Added Parrot/String.pm, to be used for constants.

	  * Added packfile.[hc] functions for allocating new constants
	    of various types.

	  * Made string_copy visible to the world in parrot/string.h.

	Wow.

	* assemble.pl: This patch makes integer constants of the form
	0b[01]+ work with perl 5.005.  The oct function in versions of perl
	before 5.6 did not handle the 0b numeric prefix; therefore, it was
	returning 0.  To fix this, I added a from_binary function that
	would take a binary string and return its decimal representation.
	Now, instead of blindly calilng oct, it makes a distinction between
	0/0x numbers and 0b numbers.

	include/parrot/bytecode.h, include/parrot/interpreter.h,
	include/parrot/packfile.h, include/parrot/parrot.h, t/op/integer.t,
	t/op/stacks.t:
	  * bytecode.[hc] removed. packfile.[hc] are the interface to the
	    packfile/bytecode file from C. May be renamed in the future.

	  * packfile.[hc] changed to use 'struct PackFile *', etc. instead
	    of 'PackFile *', just like the interpreter, etc.

	  * Constants are accessed via the interpreter's 'code' member
	    (struct PackFile * code). Macros PCONST(i) and PNCONST are
	    provided to access constants by index and the number of
	    constants, respectively (assumes a variable 'interpreter' of
	    the appropriate type is in scope).

	  * Byte Code is accessed via the interpreter's 'code' member.

	  * Changed PackFile_Constant to point to a STRING instead of
	having
	    members for the string_make() arguments. Also has a 'type' IV
	    in preparation for allowing multiple types of constants in
	    const_table.

	  * Removed hardcoded example program from test_main.c. We have
	    plenty of test programs elsewhere.

	  * test_prog now uses a PackFile to deal with the program before
	    sending it on to the interpreter.

	  * Added missing 'end' ops to some tests in t/op/integer.t and
	    t/op/stacks.t.

	This patch does two only somewhat related things.

	Parrot/Opcode.pm:  Change the hard-wired assumption that sizeof(nv)
	= 2*sizeof(iv) to a PConfig-type computed value.

	Parrot/Test.pm:  Change it to run with the perl that was used to
	generate this version of Parrot.  This is useful if, for example,
	you want to use bleadperl to build and test parrot (e.g. to try out
	various 64-bit options) but you still have a 5.6.x (or 5.005_xx)
	installed as the default 'perl' on your system.  Since perl-5.7.x
	is installed 'version-only', a plain 'perl' is quite likely to pick
	up the older perl in such cases. Such an older perl might well not
	understand pack('q') used in the assembler.

	opcode_table listing of if_i_ic and if_n_ic.  Dan had changed the
	function to only use 2 args, but the opcode_table still had three
	listed.  Fixed integer.t and number.t to use the new comparison

	* .cvsignore, MANIFEST, Makefile.in, packfile.c, pdump.c,
	include/parrot/packfile.h:
	  * C code for dealing with PackFiles as if they were objects.
	Mostly
	    read-only interface for now, but it would not be hard to make
	it
	    read-write. [packfile.c, include/parrot/packfile.h]

	  * PackFile Dumping program that falls short of disassembling, but
	    tests the above code and provides a hex listing of the byte
	code
	    contents of the PackFile. [pdump.c]

	  * New Makefile target 'pdump' for the above program, and related
	    Makefile.in changes.

	  * Updated MANIFEST to reflect the added files

	  * Update .cvsignore to ignore pdump.

	New concat op. Hey, if I'm going to talk about it in an article,
	better implement it...

2001-09-17 22:54  gregor

	* MANIFEST, Parrot/PackFile.pm, Parrot/PackFile/ConstTable.pm,
	Parrot/PackFile/Constant.pm, Parrot/PackFile/FixupTable.pm,
	lib/Parrot/PackFile.pm, lib/Parrot/PackFile/ConstTable.pm,
	lib/Parrot/PackFile/Constant.pm, lib/Parrot/PackFile/FixupTable.pm:

	Functions for reading, writing and manipulating Parrot Pack Files.
	NOTE: This is a proposed term based on the fact that the file
	contains more than just byte code, and another language (Java)
	calls its binary files by a broader notion of what's in them (Class
	Files). Since Perl has packages, and since we use pack() to write
	them, we'll call them PackFiles (at least for now).

	That does, however, beg the question of file extension. Should we
	name the files "foo.pack" instead of "foo.pbc"?

2001-09-17 20:23  thgibbs

	* interpreter.c, test_main.c: Uncuddled else statements for coding
	standard.

2001-09-17 19:57  gregor

2001-09-17 18:38  gregor

	* build_interp_starter.pl, bytecode.c, bytecode.h, interpreter.c,
	interpreter.h, test_main.c:
	  * Provides macros in interp_guts.h for setting up arrays with
	    op names and op arg counts (done via build_interp_starter.pl).

	    These are used in the op tracing

	  * The functions in bytecode.[hc] pass around a pointer to the
	length
	    of the bytecode so that later when we get to runops, we know
	    how much bytecode we've got and we can detect out-of-bounds
	    jumping. The documentation is updated, too.

	  * runops in interpreter.c now looks at interpreter->flags to
	    decide if the core of runops should be runops_trace_core or
	    runops_notrace_core. These new functions contain just the
	    while-loop portion of runops. A new function runops_generic
	    does any other setup (such as checking the bytecode
	    fingerprint) or wrapup (such as complaining if we ended up
	    out-of-bounds). NOTE: I didn't know what we should do for
	    functions in here that are not part of the api, so I gave
	    them docs with 'TODO' marks mentioning they really aren't
	    part of the api. Guidance appreciated.

	  * test_main.c now checks for '-t' arg and sets the tracing flag
	    on its interpreter instance as appropriate.

2001-09-17 17:47  bdwheele

	* assemble.pl: added some default equates, and if they're sub
	references, they are computed each time it is referenced.

2001-09-16 16:37  gregor

	* languages/jako/jakoc:
	Modified comparison implementation to use temporary registers in
	the case of register-constant and constant-register comparisons.
	This will allow the compiler to emit code that works when the
	constant-comparison ops are backed out of Parrot. If the ops ever
	make their way back in, then jakoc can emit more efficient code
	again.

2001-09-13 08:57  simon

	* MANIFEST:
	I guess nobody's been using the nightly builds...

	* assemble.pl, basic_opcodes.ops, opcode_table:
	Bitwise ops, from Brian Wheeler.

	t/test2.pasm:
	String substr op; also rearranged "encoding" to be a vtable
	pointer, not an array index. Haven't changed docs to reflect this,

	* t/euclid.pasm: Implementation of Euclid's Algorithm, courtesy of
	Gregor Purdy

2001-09-12 19:39  dan

	* basic_opcodes.ops, opcode_table: From Gregor Purdy. Adds mod_i.

2001-09-12 19:23  dan

	* interpreter.h, parrot.h: Quick placeholder entry for string
	function tables

2001-09-12 18:58  dan

	* memory.c: Added in a cast to make gcc happy.

2001-09-12 16:44  dan

	* docs/parrot_assembly.pod:

	PDD describing parrot's assembly language and the opcodes in it

2001-09-12 14:20  dan

	* memory.c:
	Fixed alignment issues with allocation

2001-09-12 10:54  simon

	* Makefile, assemble.pl, bytecode.c, disassemble.pl,
	make_op_header.pl, opcode_table, process_opfunc.pl:
	Brian Wheeler's big patch:

	* Changes the opcode_table file to provide additional information
	about the operands.  Case shouldn't be a problem since that data
	never becomes a C symbol [this is pretty much as before]

	* Padding errors solved:  assemble.pl and bytecode.c were padding
	the constants incorrectly.  It should have been 4-(size % 4), not
	just (size % 4).  It is now fixed in both places.

	* assembler has less special cases, and should be easier to hang
	error checking on

	* disassembler dumps constant table and the format is a bit
	prettier, including register names, etc.

2001-09-11 23:21  dan

	* build_interp_starter.pl, interpreter.c:

	Abstracted the runops function core into a macro for easy
	replacement later.

2001-09-11 10:43  simon

	* Configure.pl, MANIFEST, Makefile, config.h, config.h.in:
	Configure system from Brent Dax <brentdax@cpan.org>

2001-09-11 09:38  simon

	* assemble.pl, test.pbc:
	From: Bryan C. Warnock <bwarnock@raba.com> Subject: Patch:
	assembler deferred output

	Also got rid of the bytecode, since that's probably way out of
	date.

2001-09-11 09:26  simon

	* basic_opcodes.ops, opcode_table, t/test2.pasm:
	From: Bryan C. Warnock <bwarnock@raba.com> Subject: length_s_i
	patch

2001-09-10 23:20  simon

	* MANIFEST:
	And that move needs a MANIFEST change. So many things to remember!

2001-09-10 23:18  simon

	* t/: test.pasm, test2.pasm, test3.pasm:
	Move tests to t/. (Oh, CVS doesn't work the way I think it does.)

2001-09-10 23:18  simon

	* test.pasm, test2.pasm, test3.pasm:
	Move tests to t/

2001-09-10 23:04  dan

	* test3.pasm:

	Register push/pop test

2001-09-10 22:47  simon

	* basic_opcodes.ops, bytecode.c, parrot.h, test_main.c:
	Fix up format warnings, from Sam Tregar <sam@tregar.com>.
	(Modified to avoid conflict with Dan's changes.)

2001-09-10 22:45  dan

	* disassemble.pl:

	Happier about blanks in opcode_table

2001-09-10 22:40  dan

	* interpreter.c, register.c:

	Yanked out debugging code, since these work OK. The bug I want is
	elsewhere.

2001-09-10 22:30  simon

	* MANIFEST:
	Uhm. We want make_op_header.pl. We really, really do.

2001-09-10 22:26  simon

	* Makefile, TODO, assemble.pl, basic_opcodes.ops,
	build_interp_starter.pl, disassemble.pl, make_op_header.pl,
	opcode_table, process_opfunc.pl:
	Automatic opcode numbering, from Leon Brocard <acme@astray.com>.
	This means we can add lots more opcodes without fiddling about with
	the numbers. Hooray!

	Don't forget that "end" needs to be op zero, else the interpreter
	falls off the end of the code. This is Bad, and I wonder if there's
	a way around it.

2001-09-10 19:49  simon

	* MANIFEST, make_op_table_build.pl:
	Hey! This doesn't do anything...

2001-09-10 19:46  simon

	* Makefile:
	"clean" target cleanup from Bryan C. Warnock <bwarnock@raba.com>.

2001-09-10 18:31  simon

	* MANIFEST:
	You know what this means...

2001-09-10 18:30  simon

	* assemble.pl:
	"use strict" patch from Leon Brocard <acme@astray.com>. Hey, why
	wait for a release...? :)

2001-09-10 18:13  simon

	* interpreter.c:
	Bad Dan! No cookie!

2001-09-10 17:56  simon

	* README:
	A *real* README file, which doesn't claim it isn't for public
	consumption.

2001-09-10 17:02  simon

	* TODO:
	More things to do.

2001-09-10 16:56  dan

	* TODO: Added in assembler gripe. Also added a few blank lines for
	clarity

2001-09-10 16:49  dan

	* register.h, register.c: Renamed the core functions so the opcodes
	can find 'em OK. (There were some conflicts)

2001-09-10 16:48  dan

	* basic_opcodes.ops, opcode_table: Added register window ops

2001-09-10 11:07  simon

	* TODO:
	Trivial TODO list.

2001-09-10 11:05  simon

	* test.pbc, test2.pasm, test_main.c: Other string bits and pieces;
	note "-s" flag to test prog.

2001-09-10 11:01  simon

	* docs/strings.pod:
	New string documentation.

2001-09-10 11:01  simon

	* basic_opcodes.ops, opcode_table:
	String ops.

2001-09-10 10:53  simon

	* global_setup.c:
	More string fu.

2001-09-10 10:51  simon

	* memory.h:
	Just some more aliases for now. Used by string handling stuff.

2001-09-10 10:50  simon

	* assemble.pl, bytecode.c, bytecode.h:
	Temporary hack to store string constants in bytecode and recreate
	them at runtime.

2001-09-10 10:48  simon

	* op.h:
	op.h is now generated by the Makefile; remove it.

2001-09-10 10:47  simon

	* Makefile:
	clean and op.h Makefile targets.

2001-09-10 10:45  simon

	* string.c, string.h, strnative.c:
	More string vtable stuff.

2001-09-07 21:07  dan

	* assemble.pl:

	Much less picky about whitespace in the opcode_table now. (Doesn't
	whine on blank lines)

2001-09-07 16:23  dan

	* Makefile, assemble.pl, global_setup.h, interpreter.c,
	interpreter.h, opcode_table, parrot.h, test.pasm: (Here's hoping
	this takes) Added global_setup.h to declare init_world function

	Moved variable declarations out of the interpreter loop for small
	speed boost.

	Changed end opcode to now be opcode #0. A function is provided for
	it, but isn't ever executed.

	When the interpreter sees an opcode 0 in the stream it means the
	end of stream. Things were coring on Cygwin otherwise. (I think I
	was dereferencing a zero, which is bad)

2001-09-06 22:07  dan

	* basic_opcodes.ops, process_opfunc.pl:

	Minor tweaks to basic_opcodes.ops to fix some NV issues. The rest
	are minor changes now that things are in a fixed state.

2001-09-06 16:13  dan

	* basic_opcodes.c, test_opcodes.c:
	test_opcodes.c is now irrelevant--they're all in basic_opcodes.ops.

	basic_opcodes.c is now autogenerated from basic_opcodes.ops, and
	should be nuked. So it is. :)

2001-09-06 03:35  dan

	* basic_opcodes.ops, build_interp_starter.pl, process_opfunc.pl:
	Scripts to build the header file that holds the function table
	creation code, as well as the script to turn an opcode file to C
	source. (And the basic opcode functions turned into an opcode
	source file)

2001-09-06 03:31  dan

	* Makefile, interpreter.c:
	Changes to support the autogeneration of the opcode function
	pointer table in interpreter.c, along with the changes to the
	Makefile needed.

2001-09-05 13:27  simon

	* bytecode.c, config.h, docs/opcodes.pod, docs/overview.pod,
	docs/parrotbyte.pod, docs/vtables.pod:
	Added stubs for the documents; working on them this week. (What's
	left of it.) config.h change is just to type VTABLE, and the
	bytecode thing you might want to revoke. It's apidoc for the
	functions in there.

2001-09-03 18:26  simon

	* docs/strings.pod:
	A start on the string API documentation.

2001-09-03 17:43  simon

	* opcode_table:
	Since we specify the opcode number, we can rearrange to a more
	human-friendly ordering.

2001-09-03 17:42  simon

	* basic_opcodes.c:
	Coupl'a logic bugs. (I think)

2001-09-03 17:41  simon

	* string.c, string.h, strnative.c:
	Tidying up the string vtables.

2001-09-03 17:38  simon

	* make_op_header.pl:
	Spit out the whole of op.h, not just the bit in the middle.

2001-08-29 13:16  ask

	* README: it seems like we indeed can commit. What about sending
	commit mails?

2001-08-29 13:07  simon

	bytecode.h, config.h, disassemble.pl, events.h, exceptions.h,
