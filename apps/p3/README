P3 - Parrot Presentation Program

This is a small slide presenter, I'm currently developing.

Check the presentation (p3p.html) or just run it:

1) Start the webserver inside the apps/p3 directory:

  $ ../../parrot ../../examples/io/httpd2.pir

2) Point your web browser to

  http://localhost:1234/  

FILES:

  index.html   ... default start page with P3 configuration
  slides.js    ... AJAXish requests and JS events
  p3p.html     ... the slides presenting P3
  parrot.small.png  ... unfortunately a copy, but httpd2 can't serve
                        files from below doc root
  cgi-pir/slides.pir  ... creates the slides

CAVEATS:

Caused by the absence of a working parrot event sytem on Win32, httpd2 and
therefore P3 will not work on sayed platform - sorry.
