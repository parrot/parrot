PREREQUISITES
-------------

You'll need a compiler and linker, of course.  A make program
is currently encouraged, but we have had difficulties with some
versions (like nmake), so we do have a primitive script
that attempts to emulate it.

You'll also need Perl 5.005 or above, compiled to support
the types you wish to support in Parrot.  (Parrot will
make, but you'll be unable to assemble anything.)  You can find
what types are support by typing 'perl -V', and examining the
values for ivtype and nvtype.  Parrot should work with INTVALs
and FLOATVALs up to those types.

For most of the platforms that we are supporting initially,
Parrot should build out of the box.  We do not have,
however, native dynamic loading ready for OS X, and are
currently using Fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net) to fill
that gap.  Other solutions may also work.  The list of
targetted platforms can be found in docs/parrot.pod.

The current configure system is primitive, as it's only
a temporary solution.  It will be happy with most any answers
you decide to feed it.  Garbage In, Garbage Out.

You may want to peruse the list of KNOWN_ISSUES to see
what other things may be unexpected.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

For now, unpack your Parrot tarball, (if you're reading this, you've
probably already done that) and type

    perl Configure.pl

to run the Configure script. The Configure.pl script extracts configuration
from the running perl5 program. If you have a non-standard setup (like "long
long" integers on a 32-bit system), you might consider to run:

    perl Configure.pl --intval=int --opcode=int

See "perl Configure.pl --help" for more options.

This will generate a config.h header, a Parrot::Config module, and a Makefile.
The file "myconfig" has an overview of configure settings.

Next type

    make

and the interpreter should build.

You can test the assembler and interpreter by running

    make test

Look at docs/parrot.pod and docs/intro.pod for where to go from here.
If you have any problems, see the section "Reporting Problems" in
docs/intro.pod.

NOTES
-----

On some older computers with little RAM, the computed-goto dispatch core
(core_ops_cg.c) may take a while to compile or may fail to compile at all.
You can pass a flag to Configure (--cgoto=0) to disable the computed-goto
core, at a slight cost in runtime speed.
