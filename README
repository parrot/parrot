PREREQUISITES
-------------

You'll need a C compiler, a linker and a make program of course.  If you
will be building the ICU library as part of parrot (this is the
default), you will also need a C++ compiler and GNU make installed in
your PATH as either 'gmake', 'make', or 'gnumake'.

You'll also need Perl 5.6 or above to run various configure and
build scripts.

For most of the platforms that we are supporting initially,
Parrot should build out of the box.
The list of targetted platforms can be found in PLATFORMS.

The current configure system is primitive, as it's only
a temporary solution. It will be happy with most any answers
you decide to feed it. Garbage In, Garbage Out.

You may want to peruse the list of KNOWN_ISSUES to see
what other things may be unexpected.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

For now, unpack your Parrot tarball, (if you're reading this, you've
probably already done that) and type

    perl Configure.pl

to run the Configure script. The Configure.pl script extracts
configuration from the running perl5 program.  Unfortunately, the perl5
configuration is not set up to compile and link c++ programs, so you
may need to explicitly tell Configure.pl which compiler and linker to
use.  For example, to compile C files with 'cc', C++ files with
'CC', and link everything together with 'CC', you would type

    perl Configure.pl --cc=cc --cxx=CC --link=CC

See "perl Configure.pl --help" for more options.

For systems like HPUX that don't have inet_pton please run

    perl Configure.pl --define=inet_aton

This will generate a config.h header, a Parrot::Config module, platform
files and some Makefiles.

The file "myconfig" has an overview of configure settings.

Next type

    make

or

    nmake

and the interpreter should build.  If you are building the ICU library
(this is the default on most systems), you need to use GNU make instead
(or something compatible with it).

You can test parrot by running

    make test

Look at docs/parrot.pod and docs/intro.pod for where to go from here.
If you have any problems, see the section "Reporting Problems" in
docs/intro.pod. These documents are in POD format. You can view these files
with:

    perldoc -F docs/intro.pod

NOTES
-----

On some older computers with little RAM, the computed-goto dispatch core
(ops/core_ops_cg.c) may take a while to compile or may fail to compile at all.
You can pass a flag to Configure.pl (--cgoto=0) to disable the computed-goto
core, at a slight cost in runtime speed.
