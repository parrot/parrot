As best as I can determine, they are generated by line 1052 inside `sinh_of_complex_numbers`.\n\n```\n.sub sinh_of_complex_numbers\n    .local pmc config_hash, interp\n    .local string has_negative_zero\n    interp = getinterp\n    config_hash = interp[.IGLOBALS_CONFIG_HASH]\n    has_negative_zero = config_hash[\"has_negative_zero\"]\n\n    .complex_op_is(\"-2+0i\", \"-3.626860+0.000000i\", 'sinh' )\n[snip]\n    .complex_op_is(\"-2-3i\", \"3.590565-0.530921i\", 'sinh' ) # line 1052\n```\n\nNote:  Since I don't have access to Win32, I have to rely on Smolder reports.  At the current time, we are receiving steady Smolder reports on Win32 from only one reporter.  We would benefit from additional smoke testers on Win32.\n\nThank you very much.[[BR]]\nkid51\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1055","files":null}]}
