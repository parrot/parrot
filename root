However there are still remaining usages of the deprecated form in our tests, possibly in other parts of the repo and in HLLs.\n\nI'm opening this new ticket as a remainder and as help in order to solve TT #218.\n\nPlease add comments here about the status of relevant HLLs.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1857","files":null}]}
