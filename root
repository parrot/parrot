If you compile Parrot on Windows XP SP3 with GCC 4.4 this test will fail (see attached log and smolder report at [http://smolder.plusthree.com/app/public_projects/report_details/24454]). However I'm not sure wether the if clause is responsible for this error or GCC 4.4 since other Windows builds compiled with GCC 3.4 pass this test according to smolder (see http://smolder.plusthree.com/app/public_projects/report_details/24452).\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/806 by MoC","files":null}]}
