Among these are:\n\n```\n.file \"foo.pir\"\n.line 123\n```\n\nAnd another set:\n\n```\nsetfile \"foo.pir\"\nsetline 123\n```\n\nThe first set are directives using normal directive syntax, but are not used anywhere that I can find in the docs or the test suite. The second set are also directives, even though they are made to look like opcodes. This is confusing. This second set is lightly tested.\n\nI suggest we remove both. .annotate is the method we are using for identifying things like file number and line number information. These other things are mostly-forgotten relics.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2168","files":null}]}
