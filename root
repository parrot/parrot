[http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=46847 RT 46847]:  Replace dummy variable with an io object in iterator tests\n\nIn the original ticket Paul Cochrane commented:\n\n```\nIn t/pmc/io_iterator.t there are many todo items which say:\n\n$P99 = 1 # TODO replace with io object\n\nReplace this dummy value with an actual io object.\n```\n1.  [http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=46853 RT 46853]:  Setup i/o object with two lines in get_bool (vtable) test\n\nIn this ticket PTC commented:\n\n```\nIn t/pmc/io_iterator.t there is the todo item:\n\n# TODO setup i/o object with two lines\n\nThis is within the context of the tests for C\u003cget_bool (vtable)\u003e, \nalthough the reason isn't obvious to me from the code. Hopefully \nsomeone else can add enlightenment here to help whoever ends up \nworking on this ticket.\n```\n\nI am combining the ticket into one because the issues are all found within the same file.\n\nDo we have I/O iterator objects yet in Parrot?  If so, then someone knowledgeable in them should be able to update these tests rather easily.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nkid51\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1242","files":null}]}
