While my op isn't an especially performance critical one (I'm writing an op 'cus I need to get at guts more than for performance), so using string_from_literal isn't so bad, it would be nice to have been able to use CONST_STRING in there (and others may have an op that will run lots and not creating more short-lived GC-able objects is always a good thing).\n\nThanks,\n\nJonathan\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/659","files":null}]}
