However, Parrot's PCC system will automatically coerce a PMC argument to a STRING parameter using VTABLE_get_string, so these two sequences are identical. Both methods call Parrot_io_putps with the string value. The only significant difference is that .print returns nothing while .puts returns the return value from Parrot_io_putps.\n\nI suggest we merge the two methods. I don't care which name we keep, although \"print\" seems a little bit more friendly and non-C than \"puts\" does. The method can take a STRING (relying on argument autoconversion) and can return the Parrot_io_putps status value.\n\nThe amount of work to merge these methods should be small. However, we are going to need a deprecation cycle to do it.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2113","files":null}]}
