It's implementation is inefficient for the sole purpose of supporting behaviours that are unintuitive. It's code coverage is poor, and some of its operations return incorrect results.\n\nThese problems prevent it from being useful to users, so it will be removed.\n\nUsers that care about complex math are encouraged to implent their own alternative and make it public for code sharing and cooperation. An implementation by someone who cares about complex math stands a much better chance of being correct and well supported.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1892","files":null}]}
