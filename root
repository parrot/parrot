Therefore, we should drop the use of the term constant where possible, and \"constant table\" is one place I think we could.\n\nVarious alternatives have been proposed:\n- object table\n- pmc table (string table for strings, num table for nums)\n- object pool\n- packfile store\n- packfile $x (always be explicit about the packfile)\n\nMore suggestions are welcome.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2187","files":null}]}
