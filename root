That RT was closed when our JIT was deprecated, but a reference to RT #49718 remained in a `TODO`-ed test in ''t/pmc/timer.t''.  That `TODO` must be tracked in a Trac ticket.\n\nIn the original RT, chromatic noted:  ''\"At least four tests fail with the new scheduler under the JIT ...  \nI believe that this is because the JIT core doesn't emit instructions to call `Parrot_cx_handle_tasks()` often enough. These tests probably won't pass until this happens.\"''\n\nkid51\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1316","files":null}]}
