It built and tested successfully on Linux/i386.  Unfortunately, however, Parrot failed to build on Darwin/PPC.  The configuration I used was the same I've used for six years:\n\n```\nperl Configure.pl --cc=gcc --link=g++ --ld=g++\n```\n\nAs soon as I can figure out how to attach my build log, I will do so.  I repeated the attempt several times.  Each time I ended up here (some rebreaking for readability):\n\n```\n/usr/bin/g++ -o miniparrot frontend/parrot/main.o src/null_config.o src/longopt.o \\\n\"-L/Users/jimk/gitwork/parrot/blib/lib\" -L\"/Users/jimk/gitwork/parrot/blib/lib\" \\\n  -lparrot  -lm -lgmp -lreadline -lintl -undefined dynamic_lookup -L/sw/lib \\\n  -L/opt/local/lib  \n/usr/local/bin/perl tools/build/gen_version.pl \u003e \\\n runtime/parrot/include/parrot_version.pir\n./miniparrot -Iruntime/parrot/include config_lib.pir \u003e \n  runtime/parrot/include/config.fpmc\nmake: *** [runtime/parrot/include/config.fpmc] Error 1\n```\n\nWhen I restarted 'make', I would get this output:\n\n```\n/usr/local/bin/perl tools/build/parrot_config_c.pl \u003e \\\nsrc/parrot_config.c\n'runtime/parrot/include/config.fpmc' is truncated. Remove it and rerun make\nmake: *** [src/parrot_config.c] Error 255\n```\n\nBut removing 'runtime/parrot/include/config.fpmc' and re-starting 'make' just got me back to the same place.\n\nPlease let me know what diagnostics I can run.\n\nThank you very much.\nJim Keenan","files":null}]}
