Why do some scalars inherit from it and others don't? What exactly does it provide? For example, it appears to be the only PMC providing logical_not. Why does it mean to `provide scalar` and why does PDD17 say that Foo is the only PMC to do it?\n\nPerhaps the Scalar PMC should be eliminated, or perhaps it should be refactored with the Default class. At least it should be clearly documented.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1754","files":null}]}
