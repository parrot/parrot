Since NQP is a language compiler, and since it ships with Parrot, I would expect it to be loadable using this mechanism, somehow.\n\nthe load_language opcode calls src/packfile.c:Parrot_load_language(), which expects to find a \"languages/nqp/nqp.pbc\" or \"library/nqp/nqp.pbc\" in the installation directory. The NQP PBC is instead located at \"library/nqp-rx.pbc\".\n\nTo make this work and keep compatibility with the current setup, I suggest that nqp-rx.pbc be copied (or symlinked, where supported) to \"languages/nqp/nqp.pbc\". Necessary supporting files can be copied/symlinked in that same directory too.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1744","files":null}]}
