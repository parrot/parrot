However, ''t/pmc/complex.t'' still has 3 `SKIP` tests where the skip message cites RT #59630.  This must now be followed in Trac.\n\nCan the people who participated in the original RT take a look and see whether the tests can be unskipped?\n\nThank you very much.\n\nkid51\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1318","files":null}]}
