By analogy, the getattr opcode has signature getattr_p_p_s. setprop_p_s_p and setattr_p_s_p are similar and are not a problem.\n\ngetprop_p_s_p should be changed to getprop_p_p_s for symmetry with other ops.\n\nAlso, we should take some time to reconsider the whole properties mechanism, since I don't think it is used often. It _is_ used, but not often and I'm not sure that it's the best mechanism for doing what we want to do with it.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2114","files":null}]}
