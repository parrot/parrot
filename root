Indexing into a collection for rvalue return and for lvalue return are different operations; thus we need lvalue variants of get_pmc_keyed\\* to go along with the current rvalue variants, and the HLLs need to use the correct variant for the operation they wish to perform.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/787","files":null}]}
