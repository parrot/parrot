For example Parrot_pcc_get_context_struct must not be in public API, etc. Functions exposed as public should be marked as PUBLIC_API to avoid and confusion between internals and exposed API for 3rd party developers.\n## \n\nBace\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/974","files":null}]}
