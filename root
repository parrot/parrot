It still thinks `build/PARROT_REVISION` contains a numeric revision number, not a tag or checksum, which makes it emit this error:\n\n`Argument \"RELEASE_3_0_0\" isn't numeric in addition (+) at Configure.pl line 25, \u003c$REQ\u003e line 1.`\n\nThe corresponding `build/gen_parrot.pl` has a similar problem:\n\n`Argument \"RELEASE_3_0_0\" isn't numeric in addition (+) at build/gen_parrot.pl line 31, \u003c$REQ\u003e line 1.`\n\nPerhaps the simplest way to fix this would be to adapt the solution used in Rakudo's `Configure.pl`.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2003","files":null}]}
