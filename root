I am moving it into the Trac system to raise its visibility.  I believe it could be moved toward resolution by someone -- a newcomer, perhaps -- who was willing to spend some time doing Internet searching on the profiling options of various C compilers.\n\nOriginal description:[[BR]]\n'''The profiling options used in config/init/defaults.pm are specific to gcc. This should probably be specified in the relevant hints file.'''\n\nThe relevant code in ''config/init/defaults.pm'' is this:\n\n```\n    if ( $conf-\u003eoptions-\u003eget('profile') ) {\n        $conf-\u003edata-\u003eset(\n            cc_debug =\u003e \" -pg \",\n            ld_debug =\u003e \" -pg \",\n        );\n    }\n```\n\nIn the original ticket, Infinoid subsequently commented:  ''This flag convinces gcc to generate profiling code specifically for\nthe GNU profiler, `gprof`. I find it _extremely_ unlikely that this\nflag would be available and/or mean the same thing for other compilers ...''\n\nIn addition, Andy Dougherty commented:  ''[These options] are gcc-specific. A plain `-p` is common on Unix systems, but `-pg` is gcc-specific. For example, with Sun's C compiler, `-xpg` would be\nthe equivalent flag. (Though Sun's C compiler also has other profile\noptions selected by `-xprofile` ...)''\n\nCould someone research profiling options on a variety of C compilers, including the principal C compilers for Windows?\n\nThank you very much.[[BR]]\nkid51\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/855","files":null}]}
