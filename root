Now, I think the following methods on NameSpace are unused and should probably be deprecated/removed:\n- set_class\n- get_associated_methods\n- get_associated_vtable_methods\n\nRemoving these methods also helps work towards decoupling Class and NameSpace PMC types, which is a goal several devs have.  These methods are typically for internal use and are not typically used by users of Parrot directly, so I suspect we do not need to offer an alternative to any of these things\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2138","files":null}]}
