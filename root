I have tested it with `make test` and `make fulltest`; all tests pass.\n\nUnless someone can cite some reason to retain this file in the distribution, I'll merge the branch on Tuesday June 12 so that it gets a week in master before the next release.\n\nThank you very much.\nJim Keenan","files":null}]}
