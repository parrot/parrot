Especially the more\ncomplex ones like tetris and minesweeper.\n\nWe need tests.\n\n1) Basic tests for all SDL classes and interfaces. There's no GUI involved at\nall at this step. Just a test if constructors, methods, or attribute\naccessors are working/implemented as specced.\n\n2) The more daunting task of testing full-fledged examples or even SDL\napplications. We probably don't have serious GUI tests for a forseeable time,\nbut we can still test, if an application at least starts properly before\npossibly entering the event handler loop.\n\nE.g. sdl/mandel.pir can be started like this:\n\n```\n\n./parrot examples/sdl/mandel.pir --quit\n```\n\nIt'll draw the default mandel set picture and terminate immediately.\n\nWe can of course mandate that any testable sdl example/app (i.e all ;) provide\nprocessing of:\n\n```\n./parrot examples/sdl/mandel.pir --test_quit\n```\n\nor some such, which should spit out a single string \"test_ok\\n\" to stdout.\nThis string result can be tested for with standard TAP means.\n\n3) and future ... testing if the GUI of the app really works\n\nThanks,\nleo\n\nPREVIOUSLY tracked in RT#40367.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1238","files":null}]}
