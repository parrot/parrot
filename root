The Scheduler PMC is being swept during finalization before the tasks that depend on it. In r40799 I commented out a line in the VTABLE_destroy of the scheduler that prevents the scheduler mutex from being destroyed, which seems to prevent the problem.\n\nWe need a real fix for this issue.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/946","files":null}]}
