Any other esoteric platform that does not have clock_gettime() will currently not build on parrot. \n\nA proper check for each function should be done at Configure.pl-time for these. Devel::NYTProf2 has already solved most of these issues, we should emulate that.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/985","files":null}]}
