I'm sure this capability exists. However, I cannot find a way to do it that makes sense to me.\n\nThe ability to create new NCI thunks for extension projects should be easy. The process needs to be documented, and we should add the functionality to our current build infrastructure Distutils. By adding it to distutils, all projects which currently rely on that library for building will be able to make use of custom NCI thunks for their projects.\n\nThis is becoming a priority to help with GSoC.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2128","files":null}]}
