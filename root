Looking for some low hanging fruit to help Plumage and Parrot?  Here's some.  `:-)`\n\n`t/03-util.t`, which tests `src/lib/Util.nqp`, is the first test file that should get this attention, as `Util.nqp` is used throughout the project -- and in fact some or all of it may eventually move to be part of NQP-rx.\n\nThe Plumage repository is at `http://gitorious.org/parrot-plumage/parrot-plumage` .  There are basic layout and naming guidelines in `t/docs/hacking/add-tests.pod` (it's short, don't worry).\n\nIf you're a Plumage committer, just go ahead and commit.  If you want to be one, contact `japhb` on `#parrot` to get your commitbit.  Otherwise, patches attached to this ticket work just as well.\n\nTHANKS IN ADVANCE!\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1389","files":null}]}
