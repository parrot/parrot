This is a big problem for us (Rakudo devs), because it means we cannot provide binary installers that lets the user chose the installation location.\n\nWhat we want is the ability to copy a complete installation of parrot and accompanying compilers (nqp, rakudo) to another directory, and have it work from there.\n\nA possible approach would be for parrot to figure out the path to its binary at startup, and deduce its installation that way. Then it can provide that path both via a C API and an opcode. All default search paths (for example for `loadlib` and `.include`) should be relative to that installation path.","files":null}]}
