In particular, as there's no separate step for generating installable shared libs, they are stripped on generation (if `--optimize` is present), making debugging optimized builds harder than it needs to be.\n\nA cleaner approach would be to check for the `strip` utility at configure-time and let the install script take care of the stripping instead of the build-time hack in the makefile.\n\nA configure option like `--install-strip` should be added to control this new capability. Whether stripping should be the default for regular and/or optimized builds is up for debate, but keep in mind that Rakudo's build system needs to create copies of the Parrot DLL on Windows (which is not really an issue if it has a size \u0026lt;2MB, but is less-than-optimal if its size is \u0026gt;60MB), and even if the installed binaries would be stripped by default, the binaries in the build directory wouldn't be.","files":null}]}
