The one place it's documented, PDD19, contains the following description:\n\nThe C\u003c:instanceof\u003e pragma is an experimental pragma that creates a sub as a PMC type other than 'Sub'.  However, as currently implemented it doesn't work well with C\u003c:outer\u003e or existing PMC types such as C\u003cClosure\u003e, C\u003cCoroutine\u003e, etc.\n\nThis needs to be added to DEPRECATED.pod as an officially experimental feature and, more importantly, needs to be tested.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1962","files":null}]}
