First of all, here's a link to the corresponding issue in the Rakudo bug tracker: https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=114228\n\nI'm confident that the issue is Parrot-related because it goes away when I build Parrot with `--optimize`.  I've tried this with both Parrot 4.6.0 and Parrot HEAD (11f9d7c), and I encounter the error both times.\n\nThanks,\nRob","files":null}]}
