I suggest that these should be moved out into their own project. This could give these bindings more visibility, and help them to be treated like any other normal ecosystem project.\n\nI suggested this idea yesterday at #parrotsketch and received very mild support for the idea. I'm opening this ticket as an RFC in an attempt to build more support for it. If we do decide to go this route we can change this to a deprecation and begin the process of moving the bindings out of the repo.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1870","files":null}]}
