It often seems, however, that one can get away with leading wordspaces where a leading hard-tab is what is \"officially\" required.  I know that in past cleanups of the makefile templates I have substituted leading hard-tabs for leading wordspaces with no change in functionality.  Here, however, we have a case where the leading hard-tab is crucial.  Why? Because in the two code segments in the question the first line in the template file ends with '$(MINIPARROT)' while the second begins with '[hard-tab]$(MINIPARROT)'. If one is not paying attention to the hard-tab, one can come to the _incorrect_ conclusion that the second '$(MINIPARROT)' is redundant and can be removed -- which is what I did, and which is what worked until nine tested with '-j6'.\n\u003e \n\u003e Implication: We should add something to the documentation for config/gen/makefiles/root.in (and perhaps other files) to alert people to this possible source of error.  I will do that now.\n\nWe should have a `t/*.t` file that verifies tab usage.","files":null}]}
