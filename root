A Pod::Simple update called requires the new whiteline_handler, which is not provided by our own embedded Pod::Simple. \n\nBTW: I see no reason to keep Pod::Simple in parrot, since it's in perl5 core, as Pod::Checker also, but I haven't tested it without down to 5.8. This would be a seperate issue","files":null}]}
