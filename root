It has not been resolved.  chromatic looked at it in June 2008, noting that the latest version of the patch submitted by Ross did not synch up properly with our source code.\n\nThe original ticket cited [http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.internals/2005/09/msg30979.html an extensive discussion on the old perl6-internals list].\n\nThis ticket was mentioned by [http://wknight8111.blogspot.com/2009/07/parrot4newbies-platforms.html Whiteknight in his blog], also available on [http://planet.parrotcode.org/ planet.parrotcode (July 17)].\n\nI am moving this ticket to Trac.  I am attaching what I think was the last version of the patch submitted in the RT.\n\nCould someone -- particularly someone on Win32 -- take a look at this and determine:\n1.  Is there still a problem needing resolution?\n2.  Can the patch be reworked to provide a solution?\n\nThank you very much.\n\nkid51\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/850","files":null}]}
