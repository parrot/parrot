The need to consult nested structures for their shape, support for multi-element keyed lookup, etc...\n\nThese are a higher level concepts than \"view this buffer as a collection of these datatypes\", and as such do not belong in UnManagedStruct. Therefore the following aspects of unmanagedstruct are deprecated:\n- remembering structure of nested structured elements. These will now be treated as \n  `void *`\n  or \n  `void (*)(void)`\n  as appropriate\n- multi-level keyed access\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1551","files":null}]}
