This example is faulty in two ways. Firstly, it's only half the length of a real IPv6 address. Secondly, its top bits are unrealistic; it appears to be a modified-EUI-64 lower address half. Following RFC 3849, I recommend using \"2001:db8:cdbf:73bc:20a:95ff:fef5:7e5e\" as the example address.\n\nThe document also shows \"[20a:95ff::]/64\" as an example of address prefix syntax. This is also bogus in two ways. Firstly, brackets are not used in prefix syntax; the \"/\" is the separator between the prefix bits and length. Secondly, that combination of prefix bits and length is unlikely, because it involves 32 consecutive zero bits in the prefix, 16 of them at ISP level where efficient usage is expected. I suggest using \"2001:db8:cdbf:73bc::/64\" if a prefix example is required. (Without the brackets, the example doesn't fit into its current context.)\n\n-zefram","files":null}]}
