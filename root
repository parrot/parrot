This is necessary so that users of libparrot, in this case dynpmcs, can access platform-specific functions.  The problem that brought this up was that the OS pmc couldn't access Parrot_get_user_id, but I can imagine this cropping up in other places too.\n\nI've created a gci task for this and rfw plans to work on it, but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything before I merge into master.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1921","files":null}]}
