In that RT, Alberto SimÃµes stated:\n\n```\nAs discussed on the mailing list, currently parrot is being\nlinked with a bunch of libraries that will be just used by \ndynamic loading.\n\nFor instante:\n\n[ambs@rachmaninoff parrot]$ ldd parrot\nparrot:\n/Users/ambs/Projects/parrot/blib/lib/libparrot.dylib \n  (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)\n/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current\nversion 111.0.0)\n/opt/local/lib/libicuuc.38.dylib (compatibility version 38.0.0, current\nversion 38.1.0)\n/opt/local/lib/libicudata.38.dylib (compatibility version 38.0.0,\ncurrent version 38.1.0)\n/usr/lib/libutil.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)\n/opt/local/lib/libgmp.3.dylib (compatibility version 8.0.0, current\nversion 8.2.0)\n/opt/local/lib/libreadline.5.2.dylib (compatibility version 5.0.0,\ncurrent version 5.2.0)\n/opt/local/lib/libpcre.0.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current\nversion 1.1.0)\n/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Versions/A/OpenGL\n(compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)\n/System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework/Versions/A/GLUT\n(compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)\n/usr/lib/libcrypto.0.9.7.dylib (compatibility version 0.9.7, current\nversion 0.9.7)\n/opt/local/lib/libintl.8.dylib (compatibility version 9.0.0, current\nversion 9.2.0)\n/usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current\nversion 7.4.0)\n/usr/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version\n1.0.0)\n\nFrom these, I am sure GLUT/GL and pcre should not be there. \nSome others might be in excess as well, like readline (?).\n\nSo, the CC line used to build parrot should be cleaned up \nfrom these extra libraries.\n```\n\nNote:  Though I too am on Darwin (albeit an older version), I apparently don't have the `ldd` command, so I could not produce a more recent report on that platform.  It's not clear to me whether this is a Darwin-specific issues or one that applies regardless of platform.\n\nkid51\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1246","files":null}]}
