(IMO zero-fill belongs at the same semantic level as push, pop, shift and unshift. Since resizableintegerarray is (a) derived from fixedintegerarray and (b) does these other things, it seems to me a reasonable place to implement the zero-fill behaviour too.)\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1089","files":null}]}
