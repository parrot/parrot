This list might vary a bit depending on OS and platform, but I'll attach my current list.  By my count, there are currently 182 functions and 1 variable (PMCNULL) exported by default.\n\nI think the idea is that these functions should be renamed from \"funcname\" to \"Parrot_funcname\", and some #defines should be left behind (inside an #ifdef PARROT_IN_CORE) so we don't need to fix up all the callers (and therefore, don't need a deprecation cycle).\n\nI think it would be a good idea to make headerizer do this for us.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/676","files":null}]}
