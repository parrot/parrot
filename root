I am working to create a new load_bytecode op with improved semantics, which returns a PackfileView PMC with the loaded result. The new version is not in master yet, but should be shortly after 3.6\n\nI would like to deprecate the old 1-argument form of load_bytecode, so that we can start upgrading users to the newer version over the coming months.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2146","files":null}]}
