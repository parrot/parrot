Once the end of the function is reached, the specified value will be returned. However, if another return statement is encountered before the end of the function definition, that value will be used instead. Consider the following example:\n\n```\nsub demo(n)\n    if n \u003c 2 then\n        return 1\n    end\n    return 7\nend\n\nprint(\"Demo(1) = \", demo(1))\nprint(\"Demo(3) = \", demo(3))\n```\n\nOutput: \n\n```\nDemo(1) = 7\nDemo(3) = 7\n```\n\nParrot 4.0.0, Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit","files":null}]}
