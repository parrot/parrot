Several tests use read methods in a StringHanlde opened for writing. IMO will be better to have methods to get/set the string content, use the get_string/set_string/native vtable functions, or both, and have the read methods throw exceptions when not opened for read.\n- Mode when reopened without second argument: must use the flags used on the previous open, or use the 'r' default? Several tests assume the second, but works only because of the first issue.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/707","files":null}]}
