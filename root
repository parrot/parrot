Neither apply cleanly to trunk.\n\nThere is a question, however, as to whether or not the existing behavior is desirable - should we always check args? should we always check except for :main? (should we check for :main too and suggest that the programmer use .param args :slurpy to avoid any issues?)\n\nThere's a test already committed in t/op/calling.t\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1033","files":null}]}
