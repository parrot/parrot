It was entered into RT by particle on 21 Jul 2005. I am moving it to Trac at [http://wknight8111.blogspot.com/2009/07/parrot4newbies-platforms.html the suggestion of whiteknight on his blog], which is also available on [http://planet.parrotcode.org/ planet.parrotcode (July 17)].\n\nOriginal ticket description:\n\n'''the return value from 'spawnw' is highly system dependent as currently implemented. instead, 'spawnw' should return something object-like, that wraps the platform-specific semantics.'''\n\nHere are some files in our distribution that will be relevant to working on this ticket:\n\n```\nconfig/gen/platform.pm\nconfig/gen/platform/ansi/exec.c\nconfig/gen/platform/generic/exec.c\nconfig/gen/platform/generic/memexec.c\nconfig/gen/platform/openbsd/memexec.c\nconfig/gen/platform/win32/exec.c\nsrc/ops/sys.ops\ntools/dev/pbc_to_exe.pir\nt/op/spawnw.t\nt/pmc/sys.t\ndocs/book/draft/ch10_opcode_reference.pod\ndocs/porting_intro.pod\n```\n\nCf. also TT #847.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/848","files":null}]}
