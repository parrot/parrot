It looks for specific \npatterns, and if it finds them, builds relevant C code out of them.\n\nIt has no ability to check for arbitrary syntax that *doesn't* match a \npattern. It's a preprocessor (macro substitution), not a language parser.\n\nWhat could be done is have it dump anything leftover after the \nextraction into the resulting C file. Then you'd get a C error on \ncompilation.\n```\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1041","files":null}]}
