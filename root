I also grabbed all \"courtesy of\" and in one case, had to look up on a trac ticket to find out who submitted the patch was used (there was \"patch applied\" note. When applying other people's patches, IWBNI you named them specifically)\n\nI also did a diffstat to find out how many files were touched. (I didn't bother with LOC due to the # of generated files)\n\nIWBNI if this was automated for the next release manager.\n\nLow priority given a pending move from svn to git.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1713","files":null}]}
