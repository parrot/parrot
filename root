These sections depend on a sub in the constants table being the same as the sub stored in the namespace. This is true for the main interpreter, but not always true for a thread.\n\nNeed more extensive testing of the constants table in threads. It could be argued that the constants table should be cloned, or that even direct sub access should be doing a lookup in the namespace for accuracy (with a possible hit in speed).\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1120","files":null}]}
