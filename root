In both cases, it performs exactly this operation:\n\n```\nreturn !PMC_IS_NULL(VTABLE_find_method(interp, self, name));\n```\n\nAlso, VTABLE_can is not able (yet) to be overridden from PIR code, which means that the vast majority of classes written by users will always have this same exact default behavior.\n\nI suggest we deprecate and remove VTABLE_can. The \"can\" PIR op can remain, but should call VTABLE_find_method directly. \n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2042","files":null}]}
