The problem appears to be that the 'pow' opcode (a dynop) isn't being recognized by IMCC.\n\nI tried adding .loadlib 'trans_ops' to abc.pir, but that doesn't seem to have resolved the problem.  Thus, this ticket.\n\nOn a related note, it makes absolutely no sense to me that the 'pow' opcode (a basic mathematical operation) belongs in 'trans_ops'.  At the least I'd expect it to be in 'math_ops', and I really think it ought to be a core opcode.  By way of comparison, the 'sqrt' opcode is a core opcode, it seems odd that square roots are 'core' but exponentiation is not.\n\nPm","files":null}]}
