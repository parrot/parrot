And I want to copy it. Is that too much to ask? :-) (the documentation says the destination must be a path, and a directory name surely is a path).\n\n(As a side note, the error message is very ambiguous. What is a directry? Source or destination? Care to include a file name in the error message?)","files":null}]}
