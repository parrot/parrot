The syntax could look something like this:\n\n```\npmclass FooClass\n    group FooGroup\n    extends FooBase {\n\n    ATTR PMC    *foo;\n    ATTR INTVAL *bar;\n\n    FLAG FOO_IS_HAVING_A_GOOD_DAY;\n    FLAG FOO_IS_WEARING_YELLOW;\n```\n\nThis would be a good introductory task for someone wanting to get into Parrot since it's not urgent and wouldn't cause any compatibility breaks.  The majority of the code that would need to be changed is in lib/Parrot/Pmc2c/Parser.pm and lib/Parrot/Pmc2c/PMCEmitter.pm .\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/817","files":null}]}
