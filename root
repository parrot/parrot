(For example, when you \nuse the sleep opcode, when you enter a new predereferenced section, or when \nyou schedule a new event.)\n\nWe need to figure out exactly when, how, and how often to run our event loop \nmore frequently.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1154","files":null}]}
