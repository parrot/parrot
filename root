These are accessed\n\u003e via PObj_private0_FLAG, PObj_private1_FLAG, etc, although\n\u003e these flags should be #define'd on a per-PMC basis to have more\n\u003e meaningful names.\n\n\"the PMC's flags\" refers to flag bits that each object has, but \"#define'd on a per-PMC basis\" refers to a per-class source file.\n\n-zefram","files":null}]}
