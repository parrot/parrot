Let me count the ways:\n1. It uses the old embed API\n2. It passes a PackFile\\* to a function that expects a Packfile PMC.\n3. [Parrot::Interpreter - cannot use Lua](http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/74)\n4. [Parrot::Interpreter -\u003einvoke cannot handle more than one arguments](http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/75)\n5. [Parrot::Interpreter - allow compilation of PHP script](http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/76)\n6. [Parrot::Interpreter - should support multi-level namespaces](http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/77)\n7. [Parrot::Interpreter - run Pynie code](http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/79)\n\nI took a shot at updating it for the new Embed API, but the differences between the two seem fairly major and trying to learn the old API, the new API, and XS all at once was a little too much.  Probably we just want to create a new Embed module based around the new PMC centric API.","files":null}]}
