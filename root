However, if the method is multi, pmc2c uses NCI to do PCC.\n\nThere are likely advantages and disadvantages to both approaches (duplicate code vs potential object system bootstrapping issues). One thing is clear to me: whichever mechanism is used, these should be doing things the same way.\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/1475","files":null}]}
