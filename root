It never did\nanything other than guarantee that all four of its key-value pairs had defined\nvalues.  I have reworked its invocation.\n\nIf there is no objection, I will merge this branch into master on Tuesday, June 12, so that it has a week in master before the June 19 release.\n\nThank you very much.\nJim Keenan","files":null}]}
