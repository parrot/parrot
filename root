In the standard terminology, this is merely \"dispatch\". The term \"multiple dispatch\" properly refers specifically to dispatching _based on the types of more than one argument_. Dispatching based on a single argument is \"single dispatch\", no matter how many different subs it can dispatch to. Note that dispatching via a vtable is inherently single dispatch.\n\n-zefram","files":null}]}
