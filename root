Which I think means adding functions near `Parrot_file_can_read` and its relatives in `file.c`.\n\nI think the likely way to do this is with [faccessat](http://linux.die.net/man/2/faccessat).  For Windows, you'd probably still want to use `access`, since it doesn't really have a concept of effective permissions, and seems to just spawn extra logins to run things with privileges.","files":null}]}
