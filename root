(parrot 3.0.0)\n\nDebian policy requires that any exe file has its own man page. So man pages must be generated from pod doc during package build. \n\nI guess that other distro packagers will have to perform a similar task. \n\nHow about providing these man pages upstream to avoid duplicated work downstream ?\n\nAll the best\n\nOriginally http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/2045 by dod","files":null}]}
