It is used for pod caching.\n   Since localtime and mtime might deviate with daylight savings, the test is unstable and fails for me.\n   The test needs to be fixed to compare stat.mtime's instead.\n2. With t/perl/Parrot_IO.t fixed as described above to compare only stat mtime, \n   a file change does not lead to updated mtimes.\n3. It is said that perl5 works only reliably with Win32::UTCFileTime being loaded by replacing CORE stat().\n   t/dynpmc/os.t returns different values for the three stat times for perl5 and parrot.\n   I see no improvement when using Win32::UTCFileTime or not.","files":null}]}
