Parrot::Embed
-------------

This is an embedding interface to use Parrot from Perl 5.

Be afraid.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    perl ./Build
    perl ./Build test
    perl ./Build install

If you're building this within the Parrot tree (that is, if you don't have a
Parrot installed somewhere else), you need to set the proper environment
variable to tell your dynamic linker where to find the F<libparrot.so> or
F<libparrot.dll> or F<libparrot.dylib> file to load.  I believe this is
C<LD_LIBRARY_PATH> on Unix-like systems and C<PATH> on Windows.
