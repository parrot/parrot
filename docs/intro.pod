=head1 NAME

docs/intro.pod - The Parrot Primer

=head1 Welcome to Parrot

This is an update to the article 'Parrot: Some Assembly Required'
which appeared on http://www.perl.com for the 0.0.2 release of Parrot. It's
intended as being the best way for the newcomer to Parrot to learn
what Parrot is and how to use it.

=head1 What is Parrot?

First, though, what is Parrot, and why are we making such a fuss about
it? Well, if you haven't been living in a box for the past years, you'll
know that the Perl community has embarked on the design and
implementation of a new version of Perl, both the language and the
interpreter.

Parrot is related to Perl 6, but it is not Perl 6. To find out
what it actually is, we need to know a little about how Perl works.
When you feed your program into C<perl>, it is first compiled into an
internal representation, or bytecode; then this bytecode is fed to an
almost separate subsystem inside C<perl> to be interpreted. So there
are two distinct phases of C<perl>'s operation - compilation to
bytecode, and interpretation of bytecode. This is not unique to Perl;
other languages following this design include Python, Ruby, Tcl and,
believe it or not, even Java.

In previous versions of Perl, this arrangement has been pretty I<ad
hoc>: there hasn't been any overarching design to the interpreter or
the compiler, and the interpreter has ended up being pretty reliant on
certain features of the compiler. Nevertheless, the interpreter (some
languages call it a Virtual Machine) can be thought of as a software
CPU - the compiler produces "machine code" instructions for the virtual
machine, which it then executes, much like a C compiler produces
machine code to be run on a real CPU.

Perl 6 plans to separate out the design of the compiler and the
interpreter. This is why we've come up with a subproject, which we've
called Parrot, which has a certain, limited amount of independence from
Perl 6. Parrot is destined to be the Perl 6 Virtual Machine, the
software CPU on which we will run Perl 6 bytecode. We're working on
Parrot before we work on the Perl 6 compiler because it's much easier
to write a compiler once you've got a target to compile to!

The name "Parrot" was chosen after the 2001 April Fool's Joke which
had Perl and Python collaborating on the next version of their
interpreters. This is meant to reflect the idea that we'd eventually
like other languages to use Parrot as their VM; in a sense, we'd like
Parrot to become a "common language runtime" for dynamic languages.

=head2 Where we're at

It should be stressed we're still in the early stages of
development.

But don't let that put you off! Parrot is still very much usable; we've already
a lot of languages (in different state of completeness) which compile down to
Parrot bytecode. Please have a look at the F<languages/> subdirectory.

At the moment, it's possible to write simple programs in Parrot
assembly language, use an assembler to convert them to machine code and
then execute them on a test interpreter. We have support for a wide
variety of ordinary and transcendental mathematical operations, some
rudimentary string support, and some conditional operators.

=head2 How to get it

So let's get ourselves a copy of Parrot, so that we can start
investigating how to program in the Parrot assembler.

Periodic, numbered releases will appear on CPAN (we're currently on
version 0.1.0), but at this stage of the project an awful lot is
changing between releases. To really keep up to date with Parrot,
we should get our copy from the CVS repository. Here's how we do that:

 % cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.perl.org:/cvs/public login
 (Logging in to anonymous@cvs.perl.org)
 CVS password: [ and here we just press return ]
 % cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.perl.org:/cvs/public co parrot
 cvs server: Updating parrot
 U parrot/.cvsignore
 U parrot/Config_pm.in
 ....

There's also a web interface to the CVS repository, available at
http://cvs.perl.org/cvsweb/parrot/.

For those of you who can't use CVS, there are CVS snapshots built every
six hours which you can find at http://cvs.perl.org/snapshots/parrot/.

Now we have downloaded Parrot, we need to build it; so:

 % cd parrot
 % perl Configure.pl
 Parrot Configure
 Copyright (C) 2001-2003 The Perl Foundation.  All Rights Reserved.

 Since you're running this script, you obviously have
 Perl 5--I'll be pulling some defaults from its configuration.
 ...

The Configure script will then attempt to discover your local
configuration automatically; you can supply the --ask switch if
you wish to configure the build manually. You might also have a
look at:

 % perl Configure.pl --help

Once Configure has finished successfully, type C<make> (or the name of your
local C<make> program). With any luck, Parrot will successfully build. (If it
doesn't, the address to complain to is at the end of this introduction...)

=head2 The test suite

Now we should run some tests; so type C<make test> and you should see a
readout like the following:

 perl t/harness --gc-debug --running-make-test  -b t/op/*.t t/pmc/*.t \
      t/native_pbc/*.t imcc/t/*/*.t t/src/*.t
 t/op/00ff-dos...........ok
 t/op/00ff-unix..........ok
 ...
 All tests successful, 40 subtests skipped.
 Files=95, Tests=1386, 125 wallclock secs (56.96 cusr + 23.71 csys = 80.67 CPU)

(Of course, there might be more tests than this, but you get the idea;
tests may be skipped - for one reason or another - but none of them should
fail!)

=head2 Reporting Problems

If you have problems with parrot, please send a message to
bugs-parrot@bugs6.perl.org with a description of your problem.  Please
include the myconfig file that was generated as part of the build
process.

=head1 Parrot Concepts

Before we dive into programming Parrot assembly, let's take a brief
look at some of the concepts involved.

=head2 Types

The Parrot CPU has four basic data types:

=over 4

=item C<INTVAL>

An integer type; guaranteed to be wide enough to hold a pointer.

=item C<FLOATVAL>

An architecture-independent floating point type.

=item C<STRING>

An abstracted, encoding-independent string type.

=item C<PMC>

Other types like a (perl) scalar or an array.

=back

The first three types are pretty much self-explanatory; the final
type, Parrot Magic Cookies, are slightly more difficult to understand.
But that's OK! We'll talk more about PMCs at the end of the article.

=head2 Registers

The current Perl 5 virtual machine is a stack machine - it communicates
values between operations by keeping them on a stack. Operations load
values onto the stack, do whatever they need to do, and put the result
back onto the stack. This is very easy to work with, but it's very
slow: to add two numbers together, you need to perform three stack
pushes and two stack pops. Worse, the stack has to grow at runtime, and
that means allocating memory just when you don't want to be allocating
it.

So Parrot's going to break with the established tradition for virtual
machines, and use a register architecture, more akin to the
architecture of a real hardware CPU. This has another advantage: we can
use all the existing literature on how to write compilers and
optimizers for register-based CPUs for our software CPU!

Parrot has specialist registers for each type: 32 INTVAL registers,
32 FLOATVAL registers, 32 string registers and 32 PMC registers. In Parrot
assembler, these are named C<I0>...C<I31>, C<N0>...C<N31>,
C<S0>...C<S31>, C<P0>...C<P31>.

Now let's look at some assembler. We can set these registers with the
C<set> operator:

    set I1, 10
    set N1, 3.1415
    set S1, "Hello, Parrot"


All Parrot ops have the same format: the name of the operator, the
destination register, and then the operands.

=head2 Operations

There are a variety of operations you can perform: the file
F<docs/core_ops.pod> documents them, along with a little more
about the assembler syntax. For instance, we can print out the contents
of a register, or a constant:

    print "The contents of register I1 is: "
    print I1
    print "\n"


Or we can perform mathematical functions on registers:

    add I1, I1, I2  # Add the contents of I2 to the contents of I1
    mul I3, I2, I4  # Multiply I2 by I4 and store in I3
    inc I1          # Increment I1 by one
    dec N3, 1.5     # Decrement N3 by 1.5


We can even perform some simple string manipulation:

    set S1, "fish"
    set S2, "bone"
    concat S1, S2             # S1 is now "fishbone"
    substr S4, S1, 0, 1, "w"  # S1 is now "wishbone"
    length I1, S1             # I1 is 8
    end

=head2 Branches

Code gets a little boring without flow control; for starters, Parrot
knows about branching and labels. The C<branch> op is equivalent to
Perl's C<goto>:

          branch TERRY
 JOHN:    print "fjords\n"
          branch END
 MICHAEL: print " pining"
          branch GRAHAM
 TERRY:   print "It's"
          branch MICHAEL
 GRAHAM:  print " for the "
          branch JOHN
 END:     end


It can also do simple tests for whether or not a register contains a
true value:

          set I1, 12
          set I2, 5
          mod I3, I1, I2
          if I3, REMAIND
          print "5 is an integer divisor of 12"
          branch DONE
 REMAIND: print "5 divides 12 with remainder "
          print I3
 DONE:    print "\n"
          end

Note that C<if> branches to C<REMAIND> if C<I3> contains a true
(i.e. non-zero) value; if C<I3> is zero, execution falls through to the
next statement. Here's what that would look like in Perl, for comparison:

    $i1 = 12;
    $i2 = 5;
    $i3 = $i1 % $i2;
    if ($i3) {
      print "5 divides 12 with remainder ";
      print $i3;
    } else {
      print "5 is an integer divisor of 12";
    }
    print "\n";
    exit;


And speaking of comparison, we have the full range of numeric
comparators: C<eq>, C<ne>, C<lt>, C<gt>, C<le> and C<ge>. Note that you
can't use these operators on arguments of disparate types; you may even
need to add the suffix C<_i> or C<_n> to the op to tell it what type of
argument you are using - although the assembler ought to divine this
for you, by the time you read this.

=head1 Some Parrot Programs

Now let's have a look at a few simple Parrot programs to give you a
feel for the language.

=head2 Displaying the Time

This little program displays the Unix epoch time every second: (or so)

         set I3, 3000000
 REDO:   time I1
         print I1
         print "\n"
         set I2, 0
 SPIN:   inc I2
         le I2, I3, SPIN
         branch REDO
         end

First, we set integer register 3 to contain 3 million - that's a
completely arbitrary number, due to the fact that Parrot averages a
massive six million ops per second on my machine. Then the program
consists of two loops: the outer loop stores the current Unix time in
integer register 1, prints it out, prints a new line, and resets
register 2 to zero. The inner loop increments register 2 until it
reaches the 3 million we stored in register 3. When it is no longer
less than (or equal to) 3 million, we go back to the C<REDO> of the
outer loop. In essence, we're just spinning around a busy loop to waste
some time.

How do we run this? Copy the assembler to a
file F<showtime.pasm>, and inside your Parrot directory, run:

      parrot showtime.pasm

This will assemble and run the code in F<showtime.pasm>. You can also
create an assembled bytecode from the assembler by running:

      parrot -o showtime.pbc showtime.pasm

(C<.pbc> is the file extension for Parrot bytecode.)

To run this bytecode type

      parrot showtime.pbc

=head2 Finding a Fibonacci number

The Fibonacci series is defined like this: take two numbers, 1 and 1.
Then repeatedly add together the last two numbers in the series to make
the next one: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on. The Fibonacci number
C<fib(n)> is the n'th number in the series. Here's a simple Parrot
assembler program which finds the first 20 Fibonacci numbers:

 # Some simple code to print some Fibonacci numbers
 # Leon Brocard <acme@astray.com>

         print   "The first 20 fibonacci numbers are:\n"
         set     I1, 0
         set     I2, 20
         set     I3, 0
         set     I4, 1
 REDO:   set     I5, I4
         add     I4, I3, I4
         set     I3, I5
         print   I3
         print   "\n"
         inc     I1
         lt      I1, I2, REDO
 DONE:   end

This is the equivalent code in Perl:

        print "The first 20 fibonacci numbers are:\n";
        my $i = 0;
        my $target = 20;
        my $a = 0;
        my $b = 1;
        until ($i == $target) {
           my $num = $b;
           $b += $a;
           $a = $num;
           print $a,"\n";
           $i++;
        }

=head2 Further examples

Additional examples of what can be done with Parrot assembler can be
found in the F<parrot/examples/> subdirectory, and on the web at
http://www.parrotcode.org/examples/.

=head1 Where Next?

Parrot is obviously developing very rapidly, and we've still got a long
way to go before we are ready to a compiler to this platform. This
section is for those who are interested in helping us take Parrot
further.

=head2 Vtable datatypes

PMCs are almost like Perl 5's SVs and Python's Objects, only more so.
A PMC is an object of some type, which can be instructed to perform
various operations. So when we say

      inc P1

to increment the value in PMC register 1, the C<increment> method is
called on the PMC - and it's up to the PMC how it handles that method.

PMCs are how we plan to make Parrot language-independent - a Perl PMC
would have different behavior from a Python PMC or a Tcl PMC. The
individual methods are function pointers held in a structure called a
B<vtable>, and each PMC has a pointer to the vtable which implements
the methods of its "class". Hence a Perl interpreter would link in a
library full of Perl-like classes and its PMCs would have Perl-like
behaviour.

The PMC types available are described in F<doc/vtables.pod>; you can
create a new PMC with

    new P0, <typename>

and then use any of the instructions in F<ops/core.ops> and F<ops/pmc.ops>
which support PMCs. F<doc/vtables.pod> also tells you how to implement
your own PMC vtable classes.

=head2 Getting involved

We've got a good number of people working away on Parrot, but we could
always use a few more. To help out, you'll need a subscription to the
perl6-internals mailing list, (C<perl6-internals@perl.org>), where all
the development takes place. You should also keep up to date with the CVS
version of Parrot; if you want to be alerted to CVS commits,
you can subscribe to the cvs-parrot mailing list (C<cvs-parrot@perl.org>).
CVS commit access is given to those who take
responsibility for a particular area of Parrot, or who often submit
high-quality patches.

A useful web page is L<http://cvs.perl.org>, which reminds you how to use CVS,
and allows you to browse the CVS repository; the code page is a summary
of this information and other resources about Parrot. Another good
resource is L<http://www.parrotcode.org>.

So don't delay - pick up a Parrot today!
