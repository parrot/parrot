=head1 NAME

docs/parrot.pod - Parrot

=head1 The Parrot Virtual Machine

Parrot is a language-agnostic common bytecode format and an interpreter for dynamic languages.

=head2 Documentation

The Parrot documentation is spread across a wide range of files.  Good starting points are,

=over 4

=item F<intro.pod>

An introductory article on what Parrot is and how to do some interesting things with it.

=item F<overview.pod>

An overview of the Parrot architecture and design.

=item F<running.pod>

Brief descriptions of the different executables and how to run them.

=item F<faq.pod>

The Parrot FAQ.

=item F<glossary.pod>

A guide to some of the jargon that crops up repeatedly in Parrot development (and in the documentation...)

=back

More detailed information on the design and implementation of Parrot can be found in:

=over 4

=item F<pdds/>

This subdirectory contains all of the current Parrot Design Documents (PDDs). These are intended to be detailed guides to the design of the various Parrot subsystems; for instance, F<pdd03_calling_conventions.pod> specifies Parrot's inter-routine calling conventions.

=item F<pmc/>

This subdirectory contains documentation on several of the PMC types available to Parrot. Currently only a few of the available PMCs have been documented. (Patches welcome!)

=item F<dev/>

This subdirectory contains a number of pod files which discusses various implementation decisions made over the course of the development of Parrot. The intent is to keep discussion of implementation-specific issues separate from the basic design issues discussed in the PDDs.

=item F<vtables.pod>

A brief introduction to the vtable at the heart of all PMCs, and how to
implement your own PMC type.

=item F<embed.pod>

Describes the embedding subsystem in excruciating detail.

=item F<memory_internals.pod>

An introduction to the Parrot GC subsystem

=item F<parrotbyte.pod>

The Parrot bytecode format.

=item F<tests.pod>

Hints on writing tests for the Parrot interpreter.

=item F<debug.pod>

A beginner's guide to debugging the Parrot executable.

=item F<debugger.pod>

Documentation for C<parrot_debugger>, the Parrot debugger.

=head2 Supported Platforms

Parrot compiles and runs on a large number of platforms, including all of the common ones. The Parrot team is committed to supporting the following combinations as "core platforms": Linux (x86); Win32 (x86); OS X (x86 and PPC); Cygwin; FreeBSD (x86); NetBSD; OpenBSD; and Solaris. Here 'x86' includes the 'x86_64' architecture. The 'x86' descriptor means Parrot is supported to run on both 32-bit and 64-bit (AMD64 and Intel 64) CPUs.

=head2 Authors

Parrot is developed and maintained by the members of the C<parrot-dev@lists.parrot.org> mailing list. The list is archived at: L<http://groups.google.com/group/parrot-dev/>
Many people have contributed their time and their expertise to the Parrot project; I<see> the F<CREDITS> file for details.
