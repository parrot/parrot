=head1 NAME

docs/parrot.pod - Parrot

=head1 The Parrot Virtual Machine

Parrot is a language-agnostic common bytecode format and an interpreter for
dynamic languages.

=head2 Documentation

The Parrot documentation is spread across a wide range of files.  Good starting
points are:

=over 4

=item F<intro.pod>

An introductory article on what Parrot is and how to do some interesting things
with it.

=item F<overview.pod>

An overview of the Parrot architecture and design.

=item F<running.pod>

Brief descriptions of the different executables and how to run them.

=item F<faq.pod>

The Parrot FAQ.

=item F<glossary.pod>

A guide to some of the jargon that crops up repeatedly in Parrot development
(and in the documentation...)

More detailed information on the design and implementation of Parrot can be
found in:

=over 4

=item F<pdds/>

This subdirectory contains all of the current Parrot Design Documents (PDDs).
These are intended to be detailed guides to the design of the various Parrot
subsystems; for instance, F<pdd03_calling_conventions.pod> specifies Parrot's
inter-routine calling conventions.

=item F<ops/>

This subdirectory contains documentation files that are created from the
corresponding opcode files at build time. These files describe what each opcode
does and specify what arguments they take.

=item F<pmc/>

This subdirectory contains documentation on several of the PMC types available
to Parrot. Currently only a few of the available PMCs have been documented.
(Patches welcome!)

=item F<dev/>

This subdirectory contains a number of files discussing various implementation
decisions made during the course of the development of Parrot. The intent is to
keep discussion of implementation-specific issues separate from the basic
design issues discussed in the PDDs.

=item F<vtables.pod>

A brief introduction to the vtable at the heart of all PMCs, and how to
implement your own PMC type.

=item F<embed.pod>

Describes the embedding subsystem in excruciating detail.

=item F<memory_internals.pod>

An introduction to the Parrot GC subsystem

=item F<parrotbyte.pod>

The Parrot bytecode format.

=item F<packfile-perl.pod>, F<packfile-c.pod>

The APIs for accessing packed bytecode files (packfiles) from Perl and C.

=item F<strings.pod>

A description of the string implementation.

=item F<tests.pod>

Hints on writing tests for the Parrot interpreter.

=item F<debug.pod>

A beginner's guide to debugging the Parrot executable.

=item F<debugger.pod>

Documentation for C<parrot_debugger>, the Parrot debugger.

=back

=head2 Supported Platforms

Parrot compiles and runs on a large number of platforms, including all common
ones. The Parrot team is committed to supporting the following combinations as
"core platforms": Linux (x86), Win32 (x86), OS X (x86 and PPC), Cygwin,
FreeBSD (x86), NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris.
Here x86 includes the x86_64 architecture. x86 describes that Parrot is
supported to run on a 32-bit and 64-bit (AMD64 and Intel 64) CPU.

=head2 Authors

Parrot is developed and maintained by the members of the
C<parrot-dev@lists.parrot.org> mailing list. The list is archived at:
L<http://groups.google.com/group/parrot-dev/>
Many people have contributed their time and expertise
to the Parrot project; see the F<CREDITS> file for details.
