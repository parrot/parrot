=head1 Name

parrot-nqp - Not Quite Perl (6)

=head1 Description

This is "Not Quite Perl (6)" -- a High Level Language (HLL) which allows one to
write Perl6-like code. The key feature of NQP is that it's designed to be an
easy-to-parse subset of Perl 6. It is geared towards being a high-level way to
create transformers for Parrot (especially HLL compilers).  It is based on
PCT::HLLCompiler.

NQP is used as a bootstrapping language in for Rakudo, and hence developed
outside of the main Parrot git repository. It is occasionally snapshotted into
the main Parrot codebase so it can be bundled with Parrot releases and be used
by core Parrot developers as well as HLL developers.
