=head1 NAME

docs/pdds/pdd07_codingstd.pod - Conventions and Guidelines for Parrot Source
Code

=head1 ABSTRACT

This document describes the various rules, guidelines and advice for those
wishing to contribute to the source code of Parrot, in such areas as code
structure, naming conventions, comments etc.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

One of the criticisms of Perl 5 is that its source code is impenetrable to
newcomers, due to such things as inconsistent or obscure variable naming
conventions, lack of comments in the source code, and so on.  We don't intend
to make the same mistake when writing Parrot. Hence this document.

We define three classes of conventions. Those that say I<must> are mandatory,
and code will not be accepted (apart from in exceptional circumstances) unless
it follows these rules. Those that say I<should> are strong guidelines that
should normally be followed unless there is a sensible reason to do otherwise. 
Finally, those that say I<may>, are tentative suggestions to be used at your
discretion.

Note this particular PDD makes some recommendations that are specific to the C
programming language. This does not preclude Parrot  (or Perl 6) being
implemented in other languages, but in this case,  additional PDDs may need to
be authored for the extra language-specific  features.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

=head2 Coding style

The following I<must> apply:

=over 4

=item *

4 column indents for code and 2 column indents for nested CPP #directives. All
indentation must consist of spaces, no tabs (for ease of patching).

There are two exceptions to the CPP indenting- neither PARROT_IN_CORE nor the
outermost _GUARD #ifdefs cause the level of indenting to increase.

To ensure that tabs aren't inadvertently used for indentation, the following
boilerplate code must appear at the bottom of each source file. (This rule may
be rescinded if I'm ever threatened with a lynching....)

   /*
    * Local variables:
    * c-indentation-style: bsd
    * c-basic-offset: 4
    * indent-tabs-mode: nil
    * End:
    *
    * vim: expandtab shiftwidth=4:
    */


=item *

Any other tabs are assumed to be on an 8-character boundary.

=item *

ANSI C function prototypes

=item *

"K&R" style for indenting control constructs: ie the closing C<}> should line
up with the opening C<if> etc.

=item *

When a conditional spans multiple lines, the opening C<{> must line up with the
C<if> or C<while>, or be at the end-of-line otherwise.

=item *

Uncuddled C<else>s: ie avoid  C<} else {>

=item *

No C++ style comments (C<//>): some C compilers may choke on them

=item *

Mark places that need to be revisited with XXX (and preferably your initials
too), and revisit often!

=item *

In function definitions, the name starts in column 0, with the return type on
the previous line.

=item *

However, in function declarations (in header files) the return type is kept on
the same line.

=item *

Variable names should be included for all function parameters in the function
declarations.  These names should match the parameters in the function
definition.

=item *

Single space after keywords that are followed by C<()>, eg C<return (x+y)*2>,
but no space between function name and following C<()>, eg C<z = foo(x+y)*2>

=back

The following I<should> apply

=over 4

=item *

Do not exceed 79 columns

=item *

C<return foo;> rather than C<return (foo);>

=item *

C<if (!foo) ...> rather than C<if (foo == FALSE) ...> etc.

=item *

Avoid assignments in conditionals, but if they're unavoidable, use Extra paren,
e.g. C<if (a && (b = c)) ...>

=item *

Avoid double negatives, eg C<#ifndef NO_FEATURE_FOO>

=item *

Binary operators should have a space on either side; parentheses should not
have space immediately after the opening paren nor immediately before the
closing paren, commas should have space after but not before, eg

        x = (a + b) * f(c, d / e)

=item *

Long lines should be split before an operator so that it is immediately obvious
when scanning the LHS of the code that this has happened, and two extra levels
of indent should be used.

=item *

and/or split on matching parens, with the content on separate line(s) and with
one extra indent:

    do_arbitrary_function(
        list_of_parameters_with_long_names, or_complex_subexpression(
            of_more_params, or_expressions + 1
        )
    );

=back

To enforce the spacing, indenting, and bracing guidelines mentioned above, the
following arguments to GNU Indent should be used:

   -kr -nce -sc -cp0 -l79 -lc79 -psl -nut -cdw -ncs -lps

This expands out to:

=over

=item -nbad

Do not force blank lines after declarations.

=item -bap

Force blank lines after procedure bodies.

=item -bbo

Prefer to break long lines before boolean operators.

=item -nbc

Do not force newlines after commas in declarations

=item -br

Put braces on line with if, etc.

=item -brs

Put braces on struct declaration line.

=item -c33

Put comments to the right of code in column 33 (not recommended)

=item -cd33

Put declaration comments to the right of code in column 33

=item -ncdb

Do not put comment delimiters on blank lines.

=item -nce

Do not cuddle } and else.

=item -cdw

Do cuddle do { } while.

=item -ci4

Continuation indent of 4 spaces

=item -cli0

Case label indent of 0 spaces

=item -ncs

Do not put a space after a cast operator.

=item -d0

Set indentation of comments not to the right of code to 0 spaces.

=item -di1

Put declaration variables 1 space after their types

=item -nfc1

Do not format comments in the first column as  normal.

=item -nfca

Do not format any comments

=item -hnl

Prefer to break long lines at the position of newlines in the input.

=item -i4

4-space indents

=item -ip0

Indent parameter types in old-style function definitions by 0 spaces.

=item -l79

maximum line length for non-comment lines is 79 spaces.

=item -lc79

maximum line length for comment lines is 79 spaces.

=item -lp

maximum line length for non-comment lines is 79 spaces.

=item -npcs

Do not put a space after the function in function calls.

=item -nprs

Do not put a space after every ´(´ and before every ´)´.

=item -saf

Put a space after each for.

=item -sai

Put a space after each if.

=item -saw

Put a space after each while.

=item -sc

Put the `*´ character at the left of comments.

=item -nsob

Do not swallow optional blank lines.

=item -nss

Do not force a space before the semicolon  after  certain statements

=item -nut

Use spaces instead of tabs.

=item -lps

Leave space between `#´ and preprocessor directive.

=item -psl

Put the type of a procedure on the line before its name. (.c files), or

=item -npsl

Leave a procedure declaration's return type alone (.h files)

=back

Please note that it is also necessary to include all typedef types with the
"-T" option to ensure that everything is formatted properly.

A script (F<tools/dev/run_indent.pl>) is provided which runs F<indent> 
properly automatically.

=head2 Naming conventions

=over 4

=item Subsystems and APIs

The Parrot core will be split into a number of subsystems, each with an
associated API. For the purposes of naming files, data structures, etc, each
subsystem will be assigned a short nickname, eg I<pmc>, I<gc>, I<io>. All code
within the core will belong to a subsystem; miscellaneous code with no obvious
home will be placed in the special subsystem called I<misc>.

=item Filenames

Filenames must be assumed to be case-insensitive, in the sense that that you
may not have two different files called F<Foo> and F<foo>. Normal source-code
filenames should be all lower-case; filenames with upper-case letters in them
are reserved for notice-me-first files such as F<README>, and for files which
need some sort of pre-processing applied to them or which do the preprocessing
- eg a script F<foo.SH> might read F<foo.TEMPLATE> and output F<foo.c>.

The characters making up filenames must be chosen from the ASCII set
A-Z,a-z,0-9 plus .-_

An underscore should be used to separate words rather than a hyphen (-).  A
file should not normally have more than a single '.' in it, and this should be
used to denote a suffix of some description. The filename must still be unique
if the main part is truncated to 8 characters and any suffix truncated to 3
characters. Ideally, filenames should restricted to 8.3 in the first place, but
this is not essential.

Each subsystem I<foo> should supply the following files. This arrangement is
based on the assumption that each subsystem will - as far as is practical -
present an opaque interface to all other subsystems within the core, as well as
to extensions and embeddings.

=over 4

=item foo.h

This contains all the declarations needed for external users of that API (and
nothing more), ie it defines the API. It is permissible for the API to include
different or extra functionality when used by other parts of the core, compared
with its use in extensions and embeddings. In this case, the extra stuff within
the file is enabled by testing for the macro C<PERL_IN_CORE>.

=item foo_private.h

This contains declarations used internally by that subsystem, and which must
only be included within source files associated the subsystem. This file
defines the macro C<PERL_IN_FOO> so that code knows when it is being used
within that subsystem. The file will also contain all the 'convenience' macros
used to define shorter working names for functions without the perl prefix (see
below).

=item foo_globals.h

This file contains the declaration of a single structure containing the private
global variables used by the subsystem (see the section on globals below for
more details).

=item foo.sym

This file (format and contents TBD) contains information about global symbols
associated with the subsystem, and may be used by scripts to auto-generate such
stuff as the include files mentioned above, linker map tables, documentation
etc, based upon portability and extensibility requirements.

=item foo_bar.[ch] etc

All other source files associated with the subsystem will have the prefix foo_

=back

=item Header Files

All .h files should include the following "guards" to prevent
multiple-inclusion:

    /* file header comments */

    #if !defined(PARROT_<FILENAME>_H_GUARD)
    #define PARROT_<FILENAME>_H_GUARD

    /* body of file */

    #endif /* PARROT_<FILENAME>_H_GUARD */

=item Names of code entities

Code entities such as variables, functions, macros etc (apart from strictly
local ones) should all follow these general guidelines.

=over 4

=item *

Multiple words or components should be separated with underscores rather than
using tricks such as capitalization, eg C<new_foo_bar> rather than C<NewFooBar>
or (gasp) C<newfoobar>.

=item *

The names of entities should err on the side of verbosity, eg
C<create_foo_from_bar()> in preference to C<ct_foo_bar()>. Avoid cryptic
abbreviations wherever possible.

=item *

All entities should be prefixed with the name of the subsystem they appear in,
eg C<pmc_foo()>, C<struct io_bar>. They should be further prefixed with the
word 'perl' if they have external visibility or linkage, namely, non-static
functions, plus macros and typedefs etc which appear in public header files.
(Global variables are handled specially; see below.) For example:

    perlpmc_foo()
    struct perlio_bar
    typedef struct perlio_bar Perlio_bar
    #define PERLPMC_readonly_TEST ...

In the specific case of the use of global variables and functions within a
subsystem, convenience macros will be defined (in foo_private.h) that allow use
of the shortened name in the case of functions (ie C<pmc_foo()> instead of
C<perlpmc_foo()>), and hide the real representation in the case of global
variables.


=item *

Variables and structure names should be all lower-case, eg C<pmc_foo>.

=item *

Structure elements should be all lower-case, and the first component of the
name should incorporate the structure's name or an abbreviation of it.

=item *

Typedef names should be lower-case except for the first letter, eg C<Foo_bar>.
The exception to this is when the first component is a short abbreviation, in
which case the whole first component may be made uppercase for readability
purposes, eg C<IO_foo> rather than C<Io_foo>.  Structures should generally be
typedefed.

=item *

Macros should have their first component uppercase, and the majority of the
remaining components should be likewise. Where there is a family of macros, the
variable part can be indicated in lowercase, eg C<PMC_foo_FLAG>,
C<PMC_bar_FLAG>, ....

=item *

A macro which defines a flag bit should be suffixed with C<_FLAG>, eg
C<PMC_readonly_FLAG> (although you probably want to use an C<enum> instead.)

=item *

A macro which tests a flag bit should be suffixed with C<_TEST>, eg C<if
(PMC_readonly_TEST(foo)) ...>

=item *

A macro which sets a flag bit should be suffixed with C<_SET>, eg
C<PMC_readonly_SET(foo);>

=item *

A macro which clears a flag bit should be suffixed with C<_CLEAR>, eg
C<PMC_readonly_CLEAR(foo);>

=item *

A macro defining a mask of flag bits should be suffixed with C<_MASK>, eg C<foo
&= ~PMC_STATUS_MASK> (but see notes on extensibility below).

=item *

Macros can be defined to cover common flag combinations, in which case they
should have C<_SETALL>, C<CLEARALL>, C<_TESTALL> or <_TESTANY> suffixes as
appropriate, to indicate aggregate bits, eg C<PMC_valid_CLEARALL(foo)>

=item *

A macro defining an auto-configuration value should be prefixed with C<HAS_>,
eg C<HAS_BROKEN_FLOCK>, C<HAS_EBCDIC>.

=item *

A macro indicating the compilation 'location' should be prefixed with C<IN_>,
eg C<PERL_IN_CORE>, C<PERL_IN_PMC>, C<PERL_IN_X2P>. Individual include file
visitations should be marked with C<PERL_IN_FOO_H> for file foo.h

=item *

A macro indicating major compilation switches should be prefixed with C<USE_>,
eg C<PERL_USE_STDIO>, C<USE_MULTIPLICITY>.

=item *

A macro that may declare stuff and thus needs to be at the start of a block
should be prefixed with C<DECL_>, eg C<DECL_SAVE_STACK>. Note that macros which
implicitly declare and then use variables are strongly discouraged, unless it
is essential for portability or extensibility. The following are in decreasing
preference style-wise, but increasing preference extensibility-wise.

    { Stack sp = GETSTACK;  x = POPSTACK(sp) ... /* sp is an auto variable */
    { DECL_STACK(sp);  x = POPSTACK(sp); ... /* sp may or may not be auto */
    { DECL_STACK; x = POPSTACK; ... /* anybody's guess */


=back

=item Global Variables

Global variables must never be accessed directly outside the subsystem in which
they are used. Some other method, such as accessor functions, must be provided
by that subsystem's API. (For efficiency the 'accessor functions' may
occasionally actually be macros, but then the rule still applies in spirit at
least).

All global variables needed for the internal use of a particular subsystem
should all be declared within a single struct called foo_globals for subsystem
foo. This structure's declaration is placed in the file foo_globals.h. Then
somewhere a single compound structure will be declared which has as members the
individual structures from each subsystem. Instances of this structure are then
defined as a one-off global variable, or as per-thread instances, or whatever
is required.

[Actually, three separate structures may be required, for global,
per-interpreter and per-thread variables.]

Within an individual subsystem, macros are defined for each global variable of
the form C<GLOBAL_foo> (the name being deliberately clunky). So we might for
example have the following macros:

	/* perl_core.h or similar */

	#ifdef HAS_THREADS
	#  define GLOBALS_BASE (aTHX_->globals)
	#else
	#  define GLOBALS_BASE (Perl_globals)
	#endif

	/* pmc_private.h */

	#define GLOBAL_foo   GLOBALS_BASE.pmc.foo
	#define GLOBAL_bar   GLOBALS_BASE.pmc.bar
	... etc ...

=back


=head2 Code comments

The importance of good code documentation cannot be stressed enough. To make
your code understandable by others (and indeed by yourself when you come to
make changes a year later :-), the following conventions apply to all source
files.

=over 4

=item Developer files

Each source file (eg a F<foo.c> F<foo.h> pair), should contain inline POD
documentation containing information on the implementation decisions associated
with the source file. (Note that this is in contrast to PDDs, which describe
design decisions). In addition, more discussive documentation can be placed in
F<*.dev> files in the F<docs/dev> directory. This is the place for mini-essays
on how to avoid overflows in unsigned arithmetic, or on the pros and cons of
differing hash algorithms, and why the current one was chosen, and how it
works.

In principle, someone coming to a particular source file for the first time
should be able to read the inline documentation file and gain an immediate
overview of what the source file is for, the algorithms it implements, etc.

The POD documentation should follow the standard POD layout:

=over 4

=item Copyright

The Parrot copyright statement.

=item SVN

A SVN id string.

=item NAME

src/foo.c - Foo

=item SYNOPSIS

When appropriate, some simple examples of usage.

=item DESCRIPTION

A description of the contents of the file, how the implementation works, data
structures and algorithms, and anything that may be of interest to your
successors, eg benchmarks of differing hash algorithms, essays on how to do
integer arithmetic.

=item HISTORY

Record major changes to the file, eg "we moved from a linked list to a hash
table implementation for storing Foos, as it was found to be much faster".

=item SEE ALSO

Links to pages and books that may contain useful info relevant to the stuff
going on in the code - eg the book you stole the hash function from.

=back

=item Per-section comments

If there is a collection of functions, structures or whatever which are grouped
together and have a common theme or purpose, there should be a general comment
at the start of the section briefly explaining their overall purpose. (Detailed
essays should be left to the developer file). If there is really only one
section, then the top-of-file comment already satisfies this requirement.

=item Per-entity comments

Every non-local named entity, be it a function, variable, structure, macro or
whatever, must have an accompanying comment explaining it's purpose.  This
comment must be in the special format described below, in order to allow
automatic extraction by tools - for example, to generate per API man pages,
B<perldoc -f> style utilities and so on.

Often the comment need only be a single line explaining its purpose, but
sometimes more explanation may be needed. For example, "return an Integer Foo
to its allocation pool" may be enough to demystify the function C<del_I_foo()>

Each comment should be of the form

    /*

    =item C<function(arguments)>

    Description.

    =cut

    */

This inline POD documentation is parsed to HTML by running:

	% perl tools/docs/write_docs.pl -s

=item Optimizations

Whenever code has deliberately been written in an odd way for performance
reasons, you should point this out - if nothing else, to avoid some poor
schmuck trying subsequently to replace it with something 'cleaner'.

    /* The loop is partially unrolled here as it makes it a lot faster.
     * See the .dev file for the full details
     */

=item General comments

While there is no need to go mad commenting every line of code, it is immensely
helpful to provide a "running commentary" every 10 or so lines say; if nothing
else, this makes it easy to quickly locate a specific chunk of code. Such
comments are particularly useful at the top of each major branch, eg

    if (FOO_bar_BAZ(**p+*q) <= (r-s[FOZ & FAZ_MASK]) || FLOP_2(z99)) {
	/* we're in foo mode: clean up lexicals */
	... (20 lines of gibberish) ...
    }
    else if (...) {
	/* we're in bar mode: clean up globals */
	... (20 more lines of gibberish) ...
    }
    else {
	/* we're in baz mode: self-destruct */
	....
    }

=back

=head2 Extensibility

If Perl 5 is anything to go by, the lifetime of Perl 6 will be at least seven
years. During this period, the source code will undergo many major changes
never envisaged by its original authors - cf threads, unicode in perl 5. To
this end, your code should balance out the assumptions that make things
possible, fast or small, with the assumptions that make it difficult to change
things in future. This is especially important for parts of the code which are
exposed through APIs - the requirements of src or binary compatibility for such
things as extensions can make it very hard to change things later on.

For example, if you define suitable macros to set/test flags in a struct, then
you can later add a second word of flags to the struct without breaking source
compatibility. (Although you might still break binary compatibility if you're
not careful.) Of the following two methods of setting a common combination of
flags, the second doesn't assume that all the flags are contained within a
single field:

    foo->flags |= (FOO_int_FLAG | FOO_num_FLAG | FOO_str_FLAG);
    FOO_valid_value_SETALL(foo);

Similarly, avoid using a char* (or {char*,length}) if it is feasible to later
use a PMC* at the same point: cf UTF-8 hash keys in Perl 5.

Of course, private code hidden behind an API can play more fast and loose than
code which gets exposed.


=head2 Portability

Related to extensibility is portability. Perl runs on many, many platforms, and
will no doubt be ported to ever more bizarre and obscure ones over time.  You
should never assume an operating system, processor architecture, endian-ness,
word size, or whatever. In particular, don't fall into any of the following
common traps:

Internal data types and their utility functions (especially for strings) should
be used over a bare char * whenever possible. Ideally there should be no char *
in the source anywhere, and no use of C's standard string library.

Don't assume GNU C, and don't use any GNU extensions unless protected by
#ifdefs for non-GNU-C builds.


TBC ... Any contributions welcome !!!


=head2 Performance

We want Perl to be fast. Very fast. But we also want it to be portable and
extensible. Based on the 90/10 principle, (or 80/20, or 95/5, depending on who
you speak to), most performance is gained or lost in a few small but critical
areas of code. Concentrate your optimization efforts there.

Note that the most overwhelmingly important factor in performance is in
choosing the correct algorithms and data structures in the first place. Any
subsequent tweaking of code is secondary to this. Also, any tweaking that is
done should as far as possible be platform independent, or at least likely to
cause speed-ups in a wide variety of environments, and do no harm elsewhere.
Only in exceptional circumstances should assembly ever even be considered, and
then only if generic fallback code is made available that can still be used by
all other non-optimized platforms.

Probably the dominant factor (circa 2001) that effects processor performance is
the cache. Processor clock rates have increased far in excess of main memory
access rates, and the only way for the processor to proceed without stalling is
for most of the data items it needs to be found to hand in the cache. It is
reckoned that even a 2% cache miss rate can cause a slowdown in the region of
50%. It is for this reason that algorithms and data structures must be designed
to be 'cache-friendly'.

A typical cache may have a block size of anywhere between 4 and 256 bytes. 
When a program attempts to read a word from memory and the word is already in
the cache, then processing continues unaffected. Otherwise, the processor is
typically stalled while a whole contiguous chunk of main memory is read in and
stored in a cache block. Thus, after incurring the initial time penalty, you
then get all the memory adjacent to the initially read data item for free. 
Algorithms that make use of this fact can experience quite dramatic speedups. 
For example, the following pathological code ran four times faster on my
machine by simply swapping C<i> and C<j>.

    int a[1000][1000];

    ... (a gets populated) ...

    int i,j,k;
    for (i=0; i<1000; i++) {
        for (j=0; j<1000; j++) {
            k += a[j][i];
        }
    }

This all boils down to: keep things near to each other that get accessed at
around the same time. (This is why the important optimizations occur in data
structure and algorithm design rather than in the detail of the code.) This
rule applies both to the layout of different objects relative to each other,
and to the relative positioning of individual fields within a single structure.

If you do put an optimization in, time it on as many architectures as you can,
and be suspicious of it if it slows down on any of them! Perhaps it will be
slow on other architectures too (current and future). Perhaps it wasn't so
clever after all? If the optimization is platform specific, you should probably
put it in a platform-specific function in a platform-specific file, rather than
cluttering the main source with zillions of #ifdefs.

And remember to document it.

Loosely speaking, Perl tends to optimism for speed rather than space, so you
may want to code for speed first, then tweak to reclaim some space while not
affecting performance.

The section on coding style is based on Perl5's F<Porting/patching.pod> by
Daniel Grisinger. The section on naming conventions grew from some suggestions
by Paolo Molaro <lupus@lettere.unipd.it>. Other snippets came from various
P5Pers. The rest of it is probably my fault.
