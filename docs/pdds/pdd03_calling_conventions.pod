=head1 PDD 3: Calling Conventions

=head2 Abstract

Parrot's inter-routine calling conventions.





=head2 Synopsis

Not applicable.

=head2 Description

This document describes how to pass arguments from registers to subroutines,
and how subroutines can extract their parameters into registers for use.

Since Parrot's calling conventions are continuation-based, there is arguably
very little difference between a call and a return. Because of this, the
conversion rules are the same regardless of whether code is invoking a
subroutine or a return continuation.

=head3 Common Features of Argument/Return Opcodes

There are four opcodes involved in parameter and return value propagation:

=over 4

=item *

C<set_args>, for passing arguments;

=item *

C<set_returns>, for returning values;

=item *

C<get_params>, for accepting parameters; and

=item *

C<get_results>, for accepting return values.

=back

FAQ: Given Parrot's internal use of continuation-passing style ["CPS"], it
would be possible to use one pair of opcodes for both call and return, since
under CPS returns I<are> calls.  And perhaps someday we will have only two
opcodes.  But for now, certain efficiency hacks are easier with four opcodes.

The common syntax of these opcodes is:

 <set_opcode> "flags0, flags1, ..., flagsN", VAL0, VAL1, ... VALN
 <get_opcode> "flags0, flags1, ..., flagsN", REG0, REG1, ... REGN
 <get_opcode> "..., 0x200, flags0, ...", ..., "name", REG0, ...

The flags string is a literal quoted string denoting a list of zero or more
comma-separated integers.  Integers may be specified either in decimal, or if
prefixed with "0b"/"0x", in binary/hexadecimal.  There must be exactly one
integer for each value or register given.

For documentation purposes we'll number the bits 0 (low) through 30 (high).
Bit 31 (and higher, where available) will not be used.

Some values and registers do not correspond directly to values passed or
received.  (See the descriptions of the OPT_FLAG and NAMED bits, below.)

=head4 Flag Words; Common Flag Word Bits

Each integer in the flag string controls the processing of the corresponding
value or register.

These bits of each flag word have common meanings for all argument/
return-value opcodes:

    0-3   TYPE
               0b0000 = I
               0b0001 = S
               0b0010 = P
               0b0011 = N

Don't set these bits yourself; the assembler will do it.

=head3 Passing Arguments, Returning Values

Just before calling a subroutine with C<invokecc> or calling a method with
C<call_methodcc>, use the C<set_args> opcode to tell Parrot where the
subroutine's or method's arguments will come from and how they should be
expanded by the target.

Similarly, just before returning from such a subroutine or method, use
the C<set_returns> opcode to tell Parrot where the return values will
come from and how to expand them for the caller's use.

=head4 Flag Word Bits For 'Setting'

These bits of each flag word have these meanings specific to C<set_args> and
C<set_returns>:

=over 4

=item 4     C<CONSTANT>

The value is a literal constant, not a register.  (Don't set this bit
yourself; the assembler will do it.)

=item 5     C<FLAT> (P only)

If this bit is set on a PMC value, then the PMC must be an aggregate.  The
contents of the aggregate, rather than the aggregate itself, will be passed.

If the C<NAMED> bit is also set, the aggregate will be used as a hash; its
contents, as key/value pairs, will be passed as named arguments.  The PMC
must implement the full hash interface.  {{ GH #252: Limit the required
interface. }}

If the C<NAMED> bit is not set, the aggregate will be used as an array; its
contents will be passed as positional arguments.

The meaning of this bit is undefined when applied to integer, number, and
string values.

=item 6     (unused)

=item 7     (unused)

=item 8     (unused)

=item 9     C<NAMED> (C<FLAT> or string constant only)

When the FLAT bit is also set, behavior is as described above in the "FLAT"
section.  Otherwise, this bit may only be set on a unique string constant
specifying the name of the next argument (or returned value).

=back

=head3 Accepting Parameters, Accepting Return Values

As the I<first opcode> in a subroutine that will be called with
C<invokecc> or a method that will be called with C<call_methodcc>, use
the C<get_params> opcode to tell Parrot where the subroutine's or
method's arguments should be stored and how they should be expanded.

Similarly, just I<before> (yes, I<before>) calling such a subroutine or
method, use the C<get_results> opcode to tell Parrot where the return
values should be stored and how to expand them for your use.

NOTE: It should be obvious, but in case it's not: You must name only registers
as targets of these opcodes, not constants.  (You can't store anything into a
constant.  That would make it a variable.)

=head4 Flag Word Bits For 'Getting'

These bits of each flag word have these meanings specific to C<get_params> and
C<get_results>:

=over 4

=item 4     (unused)

=item 5     C<SLURPY> (P only)

If this bit is set on a P register, then it will be populated with an
aggregate that will contain all of the remaining values that have not already
been stored in other registers.

All such values will be converted to PMCs according to the detailed rules
below, and those PMCs will be stored into the new aggregate.

If the C<NAMED> bit is also set, the aggregate will be the HLL-specific hash
type and the contents will be all unassigned _named_ arguments.

If the C<NAMED> bit is not set, the aggregate will be the HLL-specific array
type and the contents will be all unassigned positional arguments.

=item 6     (unused)

=item 7     C<OPTIONAL>

If this bit is set on a register for which no value has been passed, no
exception will be raised; rather, the register will be set to a default value:
a Null PMC for P, an empty string for S, or zero for N or I.

=item 8     C<OPT_FLAG> (I only)

An I register with this bit set is set to one if the immediately preceding
B<OPTIONAL> register received a value; otherwise, it is set to zero.  If the
preceding register was not marked B<OPTIONAL>, the behavior is undefined; but
we promise you won't like it.

=item 8     C<READONLY> (P only)

I<XXX - PROPOSED ONLY - XXX>

If this bit is set on a P register that receives a value, Parrot will ensure
that the final value in the P register is read-only (i.e. will not permit
modification).  If the received value was a mutable PMC, then Parrot will
create and set the register to a {not yet invented} read-only PMC wrapper
around the original PMC.

Future Notes: Parrot's algorithm for deciding what is writable may be
simplistic.  In initial implementations, it may assume that any PMC not of a
known read-only-wrapper type is mutable.  Later it may allow the HLL to
provide the test.  But we must beware overdesigning this; any HLL with a truly
complex notion of read-only probably needs to do this kind of wrapping itself.

=item 8     (unused for S and N)

=item 9     C<NAMED> (C<SLURPY> or string constant only)

When the SLURPY bit is also set, behavior is as described above in the
"SLURPY" section.  Otherwise, this bit may only be set on a unique string
constant specifying the name of the next parameter (or returned value).

=back

=head4 Overflow and underflow

If too many or too few values are provided for the given target registers,
Parrot by default will throw an exception for C<get_params>, but not for
C<get_results>.  This error behavior can be controlled via the C<errorson> and
C<errorsoff> opcodes using C<PARROT_ERRORS_PARAM_COUNT_FLAG> for C<get_params>
and C<PARROT_ERRORS_RESULT_COUNT_FLAG> for C<get_results>.  (It is not
possible to control underflow behavior separately from overflow.)

Note that if the final target is a P register with FLAT set, then overflow can
never occur.  Similarly, if all target registers are marked B<OPTIONAL>, then
underflow is impossible.

Note also that when these errors are off, any excess destination registers in
the case of underflow are left untouched, rather than being reset to zero or
null.  Excess registers explicitly marked B<OPTIONAL> are always reset,
regardless of the error flag settings.

=head4 Ordering of named values (outgoing)

Named values (arguments, or values to return) must be listed textually after
all the positional values.  C<FLAT> and non-C<FLAT> values may be mixed in any
order.

=head4 Ordering of named targets (incoming)

Named targets (parameters, or returned values) must appear I<after> all the
positional targets.  A C<SLURPY> positional target, if present, must be the
last positional target; a C<SLURPY> named target, if present, must be the last
named target.

So the acceptable ordering of targets is:

=over 4

=item *

positional non-SLURPY    (any number)

=item *

positional SLURPY array  (optional)

=item *

NAMED non-SLURPY         (any number)

=item *

NAMED SLURPY hash        (optional)

=back

=head4 Mixing named and positional values

Positional targets can only be filled with positional values.

Named targets can be filled with either positional or named values.
However, if a named target was already filled by a positional value, and
then a named value is also given, this is an overflow error.

=head4 Type Conversions

Unlike the C<set_*> opcodes, the C<get_*> opcodes must perform conversion from
one register type to another.  Here are the conversion rules:

=over 4

=item *

When the target is an I, N, or S register, storage will behave like an
C<assign> (standard conversion).

=item *

When the target and source are both P registers, storage will behave like a
C<set> (pass by reference).

=item *

When the target is a P register and the source is an integer, the P will be
set to a new Integer[1] which has been C<assign>ed the given integer.

=item *

When the target is a P register and the source is a number, the P will be set
to a new Float[1] which has been C<assign>ed the given number.

=item *

When the target is a P register and the source is a string, the P will be set
to a new String[1] which has been C<assign>ed the given string.

=back

[1] or some other type specified by the current HLL type map, which may
substitute an alternative type for each default low-level Parrot type (array,
hash, string, number, etc.).
