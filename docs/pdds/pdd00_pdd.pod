docs/pdds/pdd00_pdd.pod - Parrot Design Documents

=head1 VERSION

$Revision$

=head1 ABSTRACT

This document defines the content and format of Parrot Design
Documents (PDDs).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PDDs are living documents, which should be maintained to reflect the
current and contemplated design of Parrot.

The key aspects of Parrot's design are its interface to the outside
world -- its feature set -- and its internal structure, both in code
and in the broader project.  Thus, PDDs descirbe Parrot's:

=over 4

=item *

I<Codable interfaces>: headers, functions, macros, file formats, etc.

=item *

I<Structural requirements> that the implementation must obey:
resource usage, portability, modularity, interdependency, etc.

=item *

I<Abstract models> that the implementation expresses or conforms to.
These models are in some sense meta-designs, because they provide
guidance for the evolution of the current design.

=item *

More? - FIXME

=back

PDDS B<should not> discuss the implementation details or trade-offs,
unless they absolutely have to.  Such implementation documentation
should go in the relevant F<*.dev> file.  On the other hand, PDDs
B<should> document design trade-offs, i.e. the paths not chosen.

These guidelines may seem fuzzy.  The line between "design" and
"implementation" is a murky one.  Still, please try to adhere to this
design for Parrot design documentation.  How you implement it is up to
you.  :-)

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

All newly created PDDs will adhere to the PDD standard current as of the time
of proposal. An example of the currently accepted layout is given in
F<docs/pdds/pdd_template.pod>, which should be used as a  template for any
future PDDs.

=head2 FORMAT

All PDDs will be written in POD parseable by the current stable
release of Perl.  Although XML is a viable solution and has its vocal
supporters, and although Parrot is intended to be used by many groups
outside of the Perl community, we have chosen POD for its simplicity
and ease of reading in plaintext form.  Conversion to other formats
(e.g. HTML) is encouraged, but the master version must be POD.

All PDDs will be written in English.  The choice of British, American,
or Other is up to the author.  Translation to other languages, like
all Perl documentation, is encouraged.  (See S<L<"PDD TRANSLATIONS">>.)

See L<pdd_template.pod> for the basic structure of a PDD.  Notes on
the sections:

=over 4

=item NAME:

A short, general description of a specific part of the Parrot design. This may
be a particular subsystem (e.g. the garbage collector), or a  more general
topic (e.g. basic Parrot datatypes).

=item VERSION:

Document version.  Since Parrot is currently kept in a Subversion
repository, the $$-delimited keyword "Revision" will do nicely.

=item MAINTAINER I<(optional)>:

The name and current email address for the point of contact for the
PDD. This is the person to whom questions, comments, and patches
should generally be addressed. This need not be the author of the
document.  By default, all PDDs are maintained by the Parrot
Architect.

=item ABSTRACT:

A quick blurb explaining the purpose of the PDD.

=item DESCRIPTION:

A description of the general nature of the PDD and how it relates to Parrot.

=item IMPLEMENTATION:

A major section of the PDD that encapsulates a free-form discussion of any and
all applicable information related to the final observations, conclusions, and
what-have-you that required writing the document in the first place.

=item ATTACHMENTS:

References to supporting files that should be considered part of the PDD.  Text
files and image files may be in any widely accepted format, which is rather
subjective.  Violators may be prosecuted.

Text files and image files should only provide supplemental information; no
fair hiding all the info in an attachment just to not have to write an
implementation section.

=item REFERENCES:

References to additional sources of information, but not those necessary for
the PDD itself.

=back

The PDD author may add any additional sections he or she wishes.

=head2 SUBMISSION CRITERIA

Proposed PDDs should be submitted to the perl6-internals mailing list (located
at perl6-internals@perl.org) for discussion, criticism and general kibitzing.
Acceptance of a particular PDD is ultimately up to the Parrot Architect.

=head2 PDD TRANSLATIONS

Should a PDD be translated into another language, the following guidelines
should be met.

=over 4

=item *

The C<MAINTAINER> section should record who made the translation.

=item *

The C<VERSION> section should include an additional note of the
translation version.
