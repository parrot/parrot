=head1 NAME

docs/pdds/pdd09_gc.pod - Garbage Collection and Dead Object Detection

=head1 ABSTRACT

This PDD describes how the GC and DOD systems work, and what's
required of PMC classes.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Doing GC takes a bit of work--we need to make sure that everything is
findable from the root set, and that we don't go messing up data
shared between interpreters. 

=head2 DOD Steps

=over 4

=item All PMCs have their live bit unset

=item All Buffers have their live bit unset

=item All PMCs in the root set are put on the trace list

=item Walk the trace list

=item The Buffer root set (stack and S registers) is walked, and any referred to buffers are marked as live

=back

For each PMC on the trace list we:

=over 4

=item Check its live bit. If set, we skip it

=item Set its live bit

=item Check its flags. If it has a custom DOD routine, we call it

=item If there's no custom DOD routine, we check the flags for one of the following:

=over 4

=item Points to a PMC. We put that PMC on the trace list

=item Points to a Buffer. We mark the buffer as live

=item Points to a Buffer of PMCs. We put all the PMCs on the trace list

=item Points to a Buffer of Buffers. We mark those buffers as live

=item Anything else we ignore

=back

=item We take the PMC off the trace list

=back

Once we're done, we scan the PMC list twice. In the first scan, dead
PMCs (i.e no live bit and no free bit) with a destructor have that
destructor called. In the second scan, dead PMCs are put on the free
list for later reallocation.

Then we scan the Buffer list. Any dead buffers (no live bit and no
free bit) are put on the free buffer list.


=head2 GC Steps

These are the steps that the GC takes:

=over 4

=item Mark all PMCs with the needs_GC flag

=item Mark all Buffers with the needs_GC flag

=item Sweep through all the PMCs with the custom_GC flag set

=item Sweep through all buffers

=item Any Buffer with needs_GC and live flags set, but without immobile set, gets copied

=item Any buffer with needs_GC set and sysmem set, but *not* with live set, gets the system free called on its contents

=item needs_GC flag is unset after copying

=back

PMCs should only have a custom GC routine if there's really a need for
the PMC to keep track of the location of the ultimate buffered data. 

For PMCs that need to hand data back to a library when their objects
are destroyed, a custom DOD routine is in order, *not* a custom GC routine.

=head2 Important safety tips

=over 4

=item Never mark PMCs or Buffers owned by other interpreters as
needing GC. Bad, very very bad.

=back

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

=head2 Blocking GC

Being able to block GC and DOD is important--you'd hate to have the
newly allocated Buffers or PMCs you've got yanked out from underneath
you. That'd be no fun. Use the following routines to control GC:

=over 4

=item Parrot_block_DOD(Interp *interpreter)

Block DOD for the passed interpreter. (But B<not> GC)

=item Parrot_block_GC(Interp *interpreter)

Block GC for the passed interpreter. (But B<not> DOD)

=item Parrot_unblock_DOD(Interp *interpreter)

Unblock DOD for the passed interpreter. (But not GC)

=item Parrot_unblock_GC(Interp *interpreter)

Unblock GC for the passed interpreter. (But not DOD)

=back

Note that the blocking is recursive--if you call Parrot_block_DOD()
three times in succession, you need to call Parrot_unblock_DOD() three
times to re-enable DOD.

=head2 Important flags

For PMCs and Buffers to be collected properly, you B<must> get the
flags set on them properly. Otherwise Bad Things Will Happen.

For PMCs:

=over 4

=item PMC_active_destroy_FLAG

The PMC has some sort of active destructor, and will have that
destructor called when the PMC is destroyed.

=item PMC_is_buffer_ptr_FLAG

Set if the data pointer points to a Buffer struct, or something like
it. If you point to a buffer and don't set this flag, it'll end up
getting collected.

=item PMC_is_PMC_ptr_FLAG

Set if the data pointer points to a PMC. Set this if it does, or
you'll find your PMC collected.

If both PMC_is_PMC_ptr_FLAG and PMC_is_buffer_ptr_FLAG are set, we
assume the pointer is to a Buffer holding PMC pointers. (Like, say,
the standard array, hash, and list PMC types do) We'll run through the
Buffer and mark all the non-NULL pointers as live PMCs.

=item PMC_private_GC_FLAG

Set if you've got your own private GC, either for marking or
collecting. The collector will call your vtable collection routine,
and the DOD sweep will call your vtable mark routine.

=item PMC_live_FLAG

Set if the system considers the PMC alive.

=item PMC_on_free_list_FLAG

Set if the PMC is on the free list.

=item PMC_constant_FLAG

Set if this is a constant PMC. Constants never die.

=back

For Buffers (and STRINGs)

=over 4

=item BUFFER_constant_FLAG

Set if the buffer is a constant. Constants never die.

=item BUFFER_immobile_FLAG

Set if the contents of the buffer can't move. Do not B<ever> set this
on a buffer pointing to memory allocated with C<Parrot_allocate>. Your
memory will be scrozzled all over.

=item BUFFER_external_FLAG

Set if the buffer points to memory that came from outside Parrot's
memory system.

=item BUFFER_sysmem_FLAG

Set if the memory came from the system malloc. When the buffer is
considered dead, the memory will be freed back to the system.

=item BUFFER_COW_FLAG

The buffer's memory is copy on write. Any changes to the buffer must
first have the buffer's memory copied. The COW flag should then be
removed.

=item BUFFER_live_FLAG

The system considers the buffer to be alive for collection purposes.

=item BUFFER_on_free_list_FLAG

The buffer is unused, and on the free list for later allocation. 

=back

=head2 Internal routines

=over 4

=item go_collect

Scans the Buffer header pools and compacts the used memory. Doesn't
check for string liveness or anything of the sort, just does a compaction.
