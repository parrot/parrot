=head1 NAME

docs/pdds/pdd09_gc.pod - Garbage Collection Subsystems

=head1 ABSTRACT

This PDD describes how DOD/GC systems work, and what's required of PMC
classes.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Doing DOD takes a bit of work--we need to make sure that everything is
findable from the root set, and that we don't go messing up data
shared between interpreters.

=head1 GC TERMS

=head2 GC Schemes

There are basically three general schemes to achieve garbage
collection.

=over 4

=item Reference counting

All objects have a count, how often they are refered to by other
objects. If that count reaches zero, the object's space can be
reclaimed. This scheme can't cope with reference loops, i.e, a loop
of dead objects, all referencing one another but not reachable from
elsewhere, never gets collected.

=item Mark and Sweep

Starting from the root set (Parrot registers, stacks, internal
structures) all reachable objects (and objects reachable from these)
are marked being alive.

Ojbects not reached are considered being dead and get collected by a
sweep through the objects arenas.

=item Copying collection

Live objects are copied into a new memory region. The old memory space
can then be reclaimed.

=back

=head2 GC Variants

=over 4

=item stop-the-world

During a GC cycle the processing of user code is stopped. Normal
operation continues only after the whole GC cycle is performed. This
can lead to arbitrary long pauses during program execution.

=item incremental

GC is done in small increments intermittent with normal program
operation.

=item real-time

The pauses caused by GC don't exceed a certain limit.

=item concurrent

The GC system runs as a separate thread and really concurrently on a
multi-processor machine.

=item parallel

Multiple threads are participating in GC.

=item generational

The object space is divided between a young generation (short-lived
temporaries) and one or more old generations. By not scanning the old
generation this can considerably speed up GC.

=back

=head1 GC SUBSYSTEMS

=head2 Fix-sized Headers

All managed objects (PMCs, Strings, Buffers) inside Parrot are subject
to garbage collection. As these objects aren't allowed to move after
creation, garbage collection is done by a non-copying scheme. Further:
as we have to cope with pointers to objects on the C stack and in CPU
registers, the garbage collection scheme is a conservative one.

DOD/GC is normally triggered by allocation of new objects, which happens
usually from some stack nesting below the run-loop. There is a small
chance that an integer on the C stack is misinterpreted as a pointer
to an object. This object would kept alive in such a case.

The live-ness information gained by dead object detection (DOD) is also the
base for collecting variable sized-data that may hang off buffers.

=head2 Variable-sized Buffer Memory

Variable-sized memory like string memory gets collected, when the
associated header isn't found to be alive during DOD. While a copying
collection could basically[1] be done at any time, its inefficient to
copy buffers of objects that are non yet detected being dead. This
implies that before a collection in the memory pools is run, a DOD run
for fixed-sized headers is triggered.

[1] Dead objects stay dead, there is no possibility of a reusal of
dead objects.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION OF FIXED-SIZED HEADER GC

=head2 General Notes

GC subsystems are rather independent. The goal for Parrot is just to
provide new object headers in the fasted possible way. How that is
achieved can be considered as an implementation detail.

While GC subsystems are independent they may share some code to reduce
Parrot memory footprint. E.g. stop-the-world mark and sweep and
incremental mark and sweep use the same arena structures and share
arena creation and DOD routines.

=head2 Initialization

Currently only one GC system is active (selected at configure or
compile time). But future versions might support switching GC systems
during runtime to accomodate for different work loads.

=over 4

=item C<void Parrot_gc_XXX_init(Interp *)>

Initialize GC system named C<XXX>.

Called from F<src/memory.c:mem_setup_allocator()> after creating
C<arena_base>. The initialization code is responsible for the creation
of the header pools and has to fill the following function pointer
slots in C<arena_base>:

=back

=head2 Arena_base function pointers

=over 4

=item C<void (*do_dod_run) (Interp *, int flags)>

Trigger or perform a DOD/GC run.

Flags is one of:

=over 4

=item DOD_trace_normal | DOD_trace_stack_FLAG

Run a normal GC cycle. This is normally called by resource shortage in
the buffer memory pools before a collection is run. The bit named
C<DOD_trace_stack_FLAG> indicates that the C-stack (and other system
areas like the processor registers) have to be traced too.

The implementation might or might not actually run a full GC cycle. If
e.g an incremental GC system just has finished the mark phase, it
would do nothing. OTOH if no objects are currently marked live, the
implementation should run the mark phase, so that copying of dead
objects is avoided.

=item DOD_lazy_FLAG

Do a timely destruction run. The goal is to either detect all objects
that need timely destruction or to do a full collection. In the former
case the collection can be interrupted or postponed. This is called
from the Parrot run-loop. No system areas have to be traced.

=item DOD_finish_FLAG

Called during interpreter destruction. The GC subsystem must clear the
live state of all objects and perform a sweep in the PMC header pool,
so that destructors and finalizers get called.

=item DOD_no_trace_volatile_roots

Trace root set except volatile roots. That is skip e.g. registers.

=back

=item C<void (*de_init_gc_system) (Interp*)>

Called during interpreter destruction. Free used resources and memory
pools.

=item C<void (*mark_object) (Interp*, Pobj*)>

Mark the object being live. This function gets invoked by the
following macro:

=item C<Parrot_pobj_lives(Interp*, PObj *)>

which might do nothing if the object is already marked live.

=back

=head2 Object allocation

Each header pool provides one function pointer to get a new object
from that pool.

=over 4

=item C<PObj * (*get_free_object) (Interp*, struct Small_Object_Pool*)>

It should return one free object from the given pool. Object flags are
returned clear, except flags that are used by the garbage collector
itself. If the pool is a buffer header pool, all other object memory
is zeroed.

=back

=head2 Write Barrier

The GC subsystem has to provide these (possibly empty) macros:

=over 4

=item C<DOD_WRITE_BARRIER(Interp*, PMC *agg, PMC *old, PMC *new)>

This macro is invoked when in aggregate C<agg> the element C<old> is
getting overritten by C<new>. Both C<old> and C<new> may be NULL.

=item C<DOD_WRITE_BARRIER_KEY(Interp*, PMC *agg, PMC *old, PObj *old_key, PMC *new, PObj *new_key)>

Like above. Invoked when a hash key is inserted, possibly replacing
and old key.

=back

=head2 The Arena_base structure

The C<arena_base> holds the mentioned function pointers, pointers to
the header pools, some statistic counters, and a pointer C<void *gc_private>
reserved for the GC subsystem.

The GC subsystem is responsible for updating the appropriate statistic
fields of the structure.

=head2 Blocking GC

Being able to block GC and DOD is important--you'd hate to have the
newly allocated Buffers or PMCs you've got yanked out from underneath
you. That'd be no fun. Use the following routines to control GC:

=over 4

=item Parrot_block_DOD(Interp *interpreter)

Block DOD for the passed interpreter. (But B<not> GC)

=item Parrot_block_GC(Interp *interpreter)

Block GC for the passed interpreter. (But B<not> DOD)

=item Parrot_unblock_DOD(Interp *interpreter)

Unblock DOD for the passed interpreter. (But not GC)

=item Parrot_unblock_GC(Interp *interpreter)

Unblock GC for the passed interpreter. (But not DOD)

=back

Note that the blocking is recursive--if you call Parrot_block_DOD()
three times in succession, you need to call Parrot_unblock_DOD() three
times to re-enable DOD.

=head2 Important flags

For PMCs and Buffers to be collected properly, you B<must> get the
flags set on them properly. Otherwise Bad Things Will Happen.

Note: don't manipulate these flags directly. Always use the macros
defined in F<include/parrot/pobj.h>.

=over 4

=item PObj_active_destroy_FLAG

The PMC has some sort of active destructor, and will have that
destructor called when the PMC is destroyed.

=item PObj_custom_mark_FLAG

The C<mark> vtable slot will be called during DOD. The mark function
must call C<Parrot_pobj_lives> for all non-NULL objects that PMC
refers too.

Please note that C<Parrot_pobj_lives> may be a macro.

=item PObj_data_is_PMC_array_FLAG

Set if the data pointer points to an array of objects. The length of
the array is C<PMC_int_val(SELF)>.

=item PObj_external_FLAG

Set if the buffer points to memory that came from outside Parrot's
memory system.

=item PObj_sysmem_FLAG

Set if the memory came from the system malloc. When the buffer is
considered dead, the memory will be freed back to the system.

=item PObj_COW_FLAG

The buffer's memory is copy on write. Any changes to the buffer must
first have the buffer's memory copied. The COW flag should then be
removed.

=back

The following flags can be used by the GC subsystem:

=over 4

=item PObj_live_FLAG

The system considers the object to be alive for collection purposes.

=item PObj_on_free_list_FLAG

The object is unused, and on the free list for later allocation.

=item PObj_custom_GC_FLAG

DWIM.
