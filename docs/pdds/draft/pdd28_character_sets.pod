docs/pdds/pdd28_character_sets.pod - Strings and character sets

=head1 ABSTRACT

This PDD describes the conventions expected for users of Parrot strings,
including but not limited to support for multiple character sets,
encodings and languages.

=head1 VERSION

$Revision$

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Here is a summary of the design decisions described in this PDD.

=over 3

=item *

Parrot supports multiple string formats, and so users of Parrot strings
must be aware at all times of string encoding issues and how these
relate to the string interface.

=item *

The native Parrot string format is an array of 32-bit Unicode codepoints
in B<grapheme normalization form>. (NFG)

=item * 

NFG is defined as a normalization which allocates at most one codepoint
to each visible character.

=item *

An interface is defined for interacting with Parrot strings and converting 
between character sets and encodings.

=head2 Encoding awareness

Parrot was designed from the outset to support multiple string formats.
Unlike other such projects, we don't standardize on Unicode internally.
This is because for the majority of use cases, it's still far more
efficient to deal with whatever input data the user sends us, which,
equally in the majority of use cases, is something like ASCII - or at
least, some kind of byte-based rather than character-based encoding.

So internally, consumers of Parrot strings have to be aware that there
is a plurality of string encodings going on inside Parrot. (Producers of
Parrot strings can do whatever is most efficient for them.) The
implications of this for the internal API will be detailed in the
implementation section below, but to put it in simple terms: if you find
yourself writing C<*s++> or any other C string idioms, you need to stop
and think if that's what you really mean. Not everything is byte-based
any more. 

However, we're going to try to make it as easy for C<*s++>-minded people
as possible, and part of that is the declaration of a Parrot native
string format. You don't have to use it, but if you do all your dreams
will come true.

=head2 Native string format

Dealing with variable-byte encodings is not fun; for instance, you need
to do a bunch of computations every time you traverse a string. In order
to make programming a lot easier, we define a Parrot native string
format to be an array of unsigned 32-bit Unicode codepoints. This is
equivalent to UCS-4 except for the normalization form semantics
described below.

This means that B<if> you've done the necessary checks, and hence you
know you're dealing with a Parrot native string, then you can continue to
program in the usual C idioms - for the most part. Of course you'll need
to be careful with your comparisons, since what you'll be getting back
will be a C<Parrot_UInt4> instead of a C<char>.

=head2 Grapheme normalization form

Unicode characters can be expressed in a number of different ways
according to the Unicode Standard. This is partly to do with maintaining
compatibility with existing character encodings. For instance, in
Serbo-Croatian and Slovenian, there's a letter which looks like an C<i>
without the dot but with two grave (C<`>) accents. If you have an
especially good POD renderer, you can see it here: E<0x209>. 

There are two ways you can represent this in Unicode. You can use
character 0x209, also known as C<LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH DOUBLE GRAVE>, 
which does the job all in one go. This is called a "composed" character,
as opposed to its equivalent decomposed sequence: 
C<LATIN SMALL LETTER I> (0x69) followd by C<COMBINING DOUBLE GRAVE ACCENT> 
(0x30F). 

Unicode standardises in a number of "normalization forms" which
repesentation you should use. We're using an extension of Normalization
Form C, which says basically, decompose everything, then re-compose as
much as you can. So if you see the integer stream C<0x69 0x30F>, it
needs to be replaced by C<0x30F>. This means that Parrot string data
structures need to keep track of what normalization form a given string
is in, and Parrot must provide functions to convert between
normalization forms. 

Now, Serbo-Croat is sometimes also written with Cyrillic letters rather
than Latin letters. The Cyrillic equivalent of the above character is
not part of Unicode, but would be specified as a decomposed pair
C<CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER I> (0x438) C<COMBINING DOUBLE GRAVE ACCENT>
(0x30F). (This PDD does not require Parrot to convert strings between
differing political sensibilities.) However, it is still visible as one
character and despite being expressed even in NFC as two characters, 
is still a single character as far as a human reader is concerned.

Hence we introduce the the distinction between a "character" and a
"grapheme". This is a Parrot distinction - it does not exist in the
Unicode Standard. 

When Parrot target languages' regular expression engines wish to match
a grapheme, then NFC is clearly not normalized enough. This is why we
have defined a further normalization stage, NFG - Normalization Form 
for Graphemes.

NFG uses out-of-band signalling in the string to refer the conforming
implementation to a decomposition table. UCS-4 specifies an encoding for
Unicode codepoints from 0 to 0x7FFFFFFF. In other words, any codepoints
with the first bit set are undefined. We define these out-of-band
codepoints as indexes into a lookup table, which maps between a
temporary ID and its associated decomposition.

In practice, this goes as follows: Assuming our Russified Serbo-Croat
string is the first string that Parrot sees, when it is converted to
Parrot's default format, it would be normalized to a single character
having the codepoint C<0x80000000>. At the same time, Parrot would
insert an entry into a temporary array at array index 0, consisting of
the bytestream C<0x00000438 0x000000030F> - that is, the Unicode
decomposition of the grapheme.

This has one big advantage: applications which don't care about
graphemes can just pass the codepoint around as if it's any other number
- uh, character. Only applications which care about the specific
properties of Unicode characters need to take the overload of peeking
inside the array and reading the decomposition.

Individual languages may need to think carefully about their concept of,
for instance, "the length of a string" to determine whether or not they
need to visit the lookup table for these strings. At any rate,
Parrot should provide both grapheme-aware and character-aware iterators
for string traversal.
