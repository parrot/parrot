=head1 DEFINITIONS

A "stream" allows input or output operations on a source/destination
such as a file, keyboard, or text console. Streams are also called
"filehandles", though only some of them have anything to do with files.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a draft document defining Parrot's I/O subsystem, for both
streams and network I/O. Parrot has both synchronous and asynchronous
I/O operations. This section describes the interface, and the
L<IMPLEMENTATION> section provides more details on general
implementation questions and error handling. 

The signatures for the asynchronous operations are nearly identical to
the synchronous operations, but the asynchronous operations take an
additional argument for a callback, and the only return value from the
asynchronous operations is a status object. The callbacks take the
status object as their first argument, and any return values as their
remaining arguments. 

The listing below says little about whether the opcodes return error
information. For now assume that they can either return a status object,
or return nothing. Error handling is discussed more thoroughly in the
implementation section.

=head2 I/O Stream Opcodes

=head3 Opening and closing streams

=over 4

=item *

C<open> opens a stream object based on a string path. It takes an
optional string argument specifying the mode of the stream (read, write,
append, read/write, etc.), and returns a stream object. Currently the
mode of the stream is set with a string argument similar to Perl 5
syntax, but a set of defined constants may fit better with Parrot's
general architecture. 

  0    PIOMODE_READ (default)
  1    PIOMODE_WRITE
  2    PIOMODE_APPEND
  3    PIOMODE_READWRITE
  4    PIOMODE_PIPE (read)
  5    PIOMODE_PIPEWRITE

The asynchronous version takes a PMC callback as an additional final
argument. When the open operation is complete, it invokes the callback
with two arguments: a status object and the opened stream object.

=item *

C<close> closes a stream object. It takes a single string object
argument and returns a status object.

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument. When the close operation is complete, it invokes the callback,
passing it a status object.

=back

=head3 Retrieving existing streams

These opcodes do not have asynchronous variants.

=over 4

=item *

C<getstdin>, C<getstdout>, and C<getstderr> return a stream object for
standard input, standard output, and standard error.

=item *

C<fdopen> converts an existing and already open UNIX integer file
descriptor into a stream object. It also takes a string argument to
specify the mode.

=back

=head3 Writing to streams

=over 4

=item *

C<print> writes an integer, float, string, or PMC value to a stream.  It
writes to standard output by default, but optionally takes a PMC
argument to select another stream to write to.

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument. When the print operation is complete, it invokes the callback,
passing it a status object.

=item *

C<printerr> writes an integer, float, string, or PMC value to standard
error.

There is no asynchronous variant of C<printerr>. [It's just a shortcut.
If they want an asynchronous version, they can use C<print>.]

=back

=head3 Reading from streams

=over 4

=item *

C<read> retrieves a specified number of bytes from a stream into a
string. [Note this is bytes, not codepoints.] By default it reads from
standard input, but it also takes an alternate stream object source as
an optional argument.

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument, and only returns a status object. When the read operation is
complete, it invokes the callback, passing it a status object and a
string of bytes.

=item *

C<readline> retrieves a single line from a stream into a string. Calling
C<readline> flags the stream as operating in line-buffer mode (see
C<pioctl> below).

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument, and only returns a status object. When the readline operation
is complete, it invokes the callback, passing it a status object and a
string of bytes.

=item *

C<peek> retrieves the next byte from a stream into a string, but doesn't
remove it from the stream. By default it reads from standard input, but
it also takes a stream object argument for an alternate source.

There is no asynchronous version of C<peek>. [Does anyone have a line
of reasoning why one might be needed? The concept of "next byte" seems
to be a synchronous one.]

=back

=head3 Retrieving and setting stream properties

=over 4

=item *

C<seek> sets the current file position of a stream object to an integer
byte offset from an integer starting position (0 for the start of the
file, 1 for the current position, and 2 for the end of the file). It
also has a 64-bit variant that sets the byte offset by two integer
arguments (one for the first 32 bits of the 64-bit offset, and one for
the second 32 bits). [The two-register emulation for 64-bit integers may
be deprecated in the future.]

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument. When the seek operation is complete, it invokes the callback,
passing it a status object and the stream object it was called on.

=item *

C<tell> retrieves the current file position of a stream object.  It also
has a 64-bit variant that returns the byte offset as two integers (one
for the first 32 bits of the 64-bit offset, and one for the second 32
bits). [The two-register emulation for 64-bit integers may be deprecated
in the future.]

No asynchronous version.

=item *

C<getfd> retrieves the UNIX integer file descriptor of a stream object.

No asynchronous version.

=item *

C<pioctl> provides low-level access to the attributes of a stream
object. It takes a stream object, an integer flag to select a command,
and a single integer argument for the command. It returns an integer
indicating the success or failure of the command.

The following constants are defined for the commands that C<pioctl> can
execute:

  0    PIOCTL_CMDRESERVED
           No documentation available.
  1    PIOCTL_CMDSETRECSEP
           Set the record separator. [This doesn't actually work at the
           moment.]
  2    PIOCTL_CMDGETRECSEP
           Get the record separator.
  3    PIOCTL_CMDSETBUFTYPE
           Set the buffer type.
  4    PIOCTL_CMDGETBUFTYPE
           Get the buffer type
  5    PIOCTL_CMDSETBUFSIZE
           Set the buffer size.
  6    PIOCTL_CMDGETBUFSIZE
           Get the buffer size.

The following constants are defined as argument/return values for the
buffer-type commands:

  0    PIOCTL_NONBUF
           Unbuffered I/O. Bytes are sent as soon as possible.
  1    PIOCTL_LINEBUF
	   Line buffered I/O. Bytes are sent when a newline is
           encountered.
  2    PIOCTL_BLKBUF
	   Fully buffered I/O. Bytes are sent when the buffer is full.
	   [Called "BLKBUF" because bytes are sent as a block, but line
	   buffering also sends them as a block, so "FULBUF" might make
           more sense.]

[This opcode may be deprecated and replaced with methods on stream
objects.]

=item *

C<poll> polls a stream or socket object for particular types of events
(an integer flag) at a frequency set by seconds and microseconds (the
final two integer arguments). [At least, that's what the documentation
in src/io/io.c says. In actual fact, the final two arguments seem to be
setting the timeout, exactly the same as the corresponding argument to
the system version of C<poll>.]

See the system documentation for C<poll> to see the constants for event
types and return status.

This opcode is inherently synchronous (poll is "synchronous I/O
multiplexing"), but it can retreive status information from a stream or
socket object whether the object is being used synchronously or
asynchronously.

=back

=head3 Deprecated opcodes

=over

=item *

C<write> prints to standard output but it cannot select another stream.
It only accepts a PMC value to write. This is redundant with the
C<print> opcode, so it will be deprecated.

=back

=head2 Filesystem Opcodes

=over 4

=item *

C<stat> retrieves information about a file on the filesystem. It takes a
string filename or an integer argument of a UNIX file descriptor [or an
already opened stream object?], and an integer flag for the type of
information requested. It returns an integer containing the requested
information.  The following constants are defined for the type of
information requested (see F<runtime/parrot/include/stat.pasm>):

  0    STAT_EXISTS
           Whether the file exists.
  1    STAT_FILESIZE
           The size of the file.
  2    STAT_ISDIR
           Whether the file is a directory.
  3    STAT_ISDEV
           Whether the file is a device such as a terminal or a disk.
  4    STAT_CREATETIME
           The time the file was created.
           (Currently just returns -1.)
  5    STAT_ACCESSTIME
           The last time the file was accessed.
  6    STAT_MODIFYTIME
           The last time the file data was changed.
  7    STAT_CHANGETIME
           The last time the file metadata was changed.
  8    STAT_BACKUPTIME
	   The last time the file was backed up. 
           (Currently just returns -1.)
  9    STAT_UID
           The user ID of the file.
  10   STAT_GID
           The group ID of the file.

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument, and only returns a status object. When the stat operation is
complete, it invokes the callback, passing it a status object and an
integer containing the status information.

=item *

C<unlink> deletes a file from the filesystem. It takes a single string
argument of a filename (including the path).

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument. When the unlink operation is complete, it invokes the
callback, passing it a status object.

=item *

C<rmdir> deletes a directory from the filesystem if that directory is
empty. It takes a single string argument of a directory name (including
the path).

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument. When the rmdir operation is complete, it invokes the callback,
passing it a status object.

=item *

C<opendir> opens a stream object for a directory. It takes a single
string argument of a directory name (including the path) and returns a
stream object.

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument, and only returns a status object. When the opendir operation
is complete, it invokes the callback, passing it a status object and a
newly created stream object.

=item *

C<readdir> reads a single item from an open directory stream object. It
takes a single stream object argument and returns a string containing
the path and filename/directory name of the current item. (i.e. the
directory stream object acts as an iterator.)

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument, and only returns a status object. When the readdir operation
is complete, it invokes the callback, passing it a status object and the
string result.

=item *

C<telldir> returns the current position of C<readdir> operations on a
directory stream object.

No asynchronous version.

=item *

C<seekdir> sets the current position of C<readdir> operations on a
directory stream object. It takes a stream object argument and an
integer for the position. [The system C<seekdir> requires that the
position argument be the result of a previous C<telldir> operation.]

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument. When the seekdir operation is complete, it invokes the
callback, passing it a status object and the directory stream object it
was called on.

=item *

C<rewinddir> sets the current position of C<readdir> operations on a
directory stream object back to the beginning of the directory. It takes
a stream object argument.

No asynchronous version.

=item *

C<closedir> closes a directory stream object. It takes a single stream
object argument.

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument. When the closedir operation is complete, it invokes the
callback, passing it a status object.

=back

=head2 Network I/O Opcodes

Most of these opcodes conform to the standard UNIX interface, but the
layer API allows alternate implementations for each.

=over 4

=item *

C<socket> returns a new socket object from a given address family,
socket type, and protocol number (all integers). The socket object's
boolean value can be tested for whether the socket was created.

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument, and only returns a status object. When the socket operation is
complete, it invokes the callback, passing it a status object and a new
socket object.

=item *

C<sockaddr> returns an object representing a socket address, generated
from a port number (integer) and an address (string).

No asynchronous version.

=item *

C<connect> connects a socket object to an address.

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument, and only returns a status object. When the socket operation is
complete, it invokes the callback, passing it a status object and the
socket object it was called on. [If you want notification when a connect
operation is completed, you probably want to do something with that
connected socket object.]

=item *

C<recv> receives a message from a connected socket object. It returns
the message in a string.

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument, and only returns a status object. When the recv operation is
complete, it invokes the callback, passing it a status object and a
string containing the received message.

=item *

C<send> sends a message string to a connected socket object. 

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument, and only returns a status object. When the send operation is
complete, it invokes the callback, passing it a status object.

=item *

C<sendto> sends a message string to an address specified in an address
object (first connecting to the address).

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument, and only returns a status object. When the sendto operation is
complete, it invokes the callback, passing it a status object.


=item *

C<bind> binds a socket object to the port and address specified by an
address object (the packed result of C<sockaddr>).

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument, and only returns a status object. When the bind operation is
complete, it invokes the callback, passing it a status object and the
socket object it was called on. [If you want notification when a bind
operation is completed, you probably want to do something with that
bound socket object.]

=item *

C<listen> specifies that a socket object is willing to accept incoming
connections. The integer argument gives the maximum size of the queue
for pending connections.

There is no asynchronous version. C<listen> marks a set of attributes on
the socket object.

=item *

C<accept> accepts a new connection on a given socket object, and returns
a newly created socket object for the connection. 

The asynchronous version takes an additional final PMC callback
argument, and only returns a status object. When the accept operation
receives a new connection, it invokes the callback, passing it a status
object and a newly created socket object for the connection. [While the
synchronous C<accept> has to be called repeatedly in a loop (once for
each connection received), the asynchronous version is only called once,
but continues to send new connection events until the socket is closed.]

=item *

C<shutdown> closes a socket object for reading, for writing, or for all
I/O. It takes a socket object argument and an integer argument for the
type of shutdown:

  0    PIOSHUTDOWN_READ
           Close the socket object for reading.
  1    PIOSHUTDOWN_WRITE
           Close the socket object for writing.
  2    PIOSHUTDOWN
           Close the socket object.

=back


=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

The Parrot I/O subsystem uses a per-interpreter stack to provide a
layer-based approach to I/O. Each layer implements a subset of the
C<ParrotIOLayerAPI> vtable. To find an I/O function, the layer stack is
searched downwards until a non-NULL function pointer is found for
that particular slot.

=head2 Synchronous and Asynchronous Operations

Currently, Parrot only implements synchronous I/O operations.
Asynchronous operations are essentially the same as the synchronous
operations, but each asynchronous operation runs in its own thread.

Note: this is a deviation from the existing plan, which had all I/O
operations run internally as asynchronous, and the synchronous
operations as a compatibility layer on top of the asynchronous
operations. This conceptual simplification means that all I/O operations
are possible without threading support (for example, in a stripped-down
version of Parrot running on a PDA). [Asynchronous operations don't have
to use Parrot threads, they could use some alternate threading
implementation. But it's overkill to develop two threading
implementations. If Parrot threads turn out to be too heavyweight, we
may want to look into a lighter weight variation for asynchronous
operations.]

The asynchronous I/O implementation will use Parrot's I/O layer
architecture so some platforms can take advantage of their built-in
asynchronous operations instead of using Parrot threads.

Communication between the calling code and the asynchronous operation
thread will be handled by a shared status object. The operation thread
will update the status object whenever the status changes, and the
calling code can check the status object at any time. [Twisted has an
interesting variation on this, in that it replaces the status object
with the returned result of the asynchronous call when the call is
complete. That is probably too confusing, but we might give the status
object a reference to the returned result.]

The current strategy for differentating the synchronous calls from
asynchronous ones relies on the presence of a callback argument in the
asynchronous calls. If we wanted asynchronous calls that don't supply
callbacks (perhaps if the user wants to manually check later if the
operation succeded) we would need another strategy to differentiate the
two. This is probably enough of a fringe case that we don't need to
provide opcodes for it, provided they can access the functionality via
methods on ParrotIO objects.

=head2 Error Handling

Currently some of the networking opcodes (C<connect>, C<recv>, C<send>,
C<poll>, C<bind>, and C<listen>) return an integer indicating the status
of the call, -1 or a system error code if unsuccessful. Other I/O
opcodes (such as C<getfd> and C<accept>) have various different
strategies for error notification, and others have no way of marking
errors at all. We want to unify all I/O opcodes so they use a consistent
strategy for error notification. There are several options in how we do
this.

=head3 Integer status codes

One approach is to have every I/O operation return an integer status
code indicating success or failure. This approach has the advantage of
being lightweight: returning a single additional integer is cheap. The
disadvantage is that it's not very flexible: the only way to look for
errors is to check the integer return value, possibly comparing it to a
predefined set of error constants.

=head3 Exceptions

Another option is to have all I/O operations throw exceptions on errors.
The advantage is that it keeps the error tracking information
out-of-band, so it doesn't affect the arguments or return values of the
calls (some opcodes that have a return value plus an integer status code
have odd looking signatures). One disadvantage of this approach is that
it forces all users to handle exceptions from I/O operations even if
they aren't using exceptions otherwise. 

A more significant disadvantage is that exeptions don't work well with
asynchronous operations. Exception handlers are set for a particular
dynamic scope, but with an asynchronous operation, by the time an
exception is thrown execution has already left the dynamic scope where
the exception handler was set. [Though, this partly depends on how
exceptions are implemented.]

=head3 Error callbacks

A minor variation on the exceptions option is to pass an error callback
into each I/O opcode. This solves the problem of asynchronous operations
because the operation has its own custom error handling code rather than
relying on an exception handler in its dynamic scope.

The disadvantage is that the user has to define a custom error handler
routine for every call. It also doesn't cope well with cases where
multiple different kinds of errors may be returned by a single opcode.
(The one error handler would have to cope with all possible types of
errors.) There is an easier way.

=head3 Hybrid solution

Another option is to return a status object from each I/O operation. The
status object could be used to get an integer status code, string
status/error message, or boolean success value. It could also provide a
method to throw an exception on error conditions. There could even be a
global option (or an option set on a particular I/O object) that tells
Parrot to always throw exceptions on errors in synchronous I/O
operations, implemented by calling this method on the status object
before returning from the I/O opcode.

The advantages are that this works well with asynchronous and
synchronous operations, and provides flexibility for multiple different
uses.  Also, something like a status object will be needed anyway to
allow users to check on the status of a particular asynchronous call in
progress, so this is a nice unification.

The disadvantage is that a status object involves more overhead than a
simple integer status code.

=head2 IPv6 Support

The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is in progress, though not likely to be
complete anytime soon. Most operating systems today offer at least
dual-stack IPv6 implementations, so they can use either IPv4 or IPv6,
depending on what's available. Parrot also needs to support either
protocol. For the most part, the network I/O opcodes should internally
handle either addressing scheme, without requiring the user to specify
which scheme is being used.

IETF recommends defaulting to IPv6 connections and falling back to IPv4
connections when IPv6 fails. This would give us more solid testing of
Parrot's compatibility IPv6, but may be too slow. Either way, it's a
good idea to make setting the default (or selecting one exclusively) an
option when compiling Parrot.

The most important issues for Parrot to consider with IPv6 are:

=over 4

=item *

Support 128 bit addresses. IPv6 addresses are colon-separated
hexadecimal numbers, such as C<20a:95ff:fef5:7e5e>.

=item *

Any address parsing should be able to support the address separated from
a port number or prefix/length by brackets: C<[20a:95ff:fef5:7e5e]:80>
and C<[20a:95ff::]/64>.

=item *

Packed addresses, such as the result of the C<sockaddr> opcode, should
be passed around as an object (or at least a structure) rather than as a
string.

=back

See the relevant IETF RFCs: "Application Aspects of IPv6 Transition"
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4038.txt) and "Basic Socket Interface
Extensions for IPv6" (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3493.txt).

=head2 Excerpt

[Below is an excerpt from "Perl 6 and Parrot Essentials", included to
seed discussion.]

Parrot's base I/O system is fully asynchronous I/O with callbacks and
per-request private data. Since this is massive overkill in many cases,
we have a plain vanilla synchronous I/O layer that your programs can use
if they don't need the extra power.

Asynchronous I/O is conceptually pretty simple. Your program makes an
I/O request. The system takes that request and returns control to your
program, which keeps running. Meanwhile the system works on satisfying
the I/O request. When the request is satisfied, the system notifies
your program in some way. Since there can be multiple requests
outstanding, and you can't be sure exactly what your program will be
doing when a request is satisfied, programs that make use of
asynchronous I/O can be complex.

Synchronous I/O is even simpler. Your program makes a request to the
system and then waits until that request is done. There can be only
one request in process at a time, and you always know what you're
doing (waiting) while the request is being processed. It makes your
program much simpler, since you don't have to do any sort of
coordination or synchronization.

The big benefit of asynchronous I/O systems is that they generally
have a much higher throughput than a synchronous system. They move
data around much faster--in some cases three or four times faster.
This is because the system can be busy moving data to or from disk
while your program is busy processing data that it got from a previous
request.

For disk devices, having multiple outstanding requests--especially on
a busy system--allows the system to order read and write requests to
take better advantage of the underlying hardware. For example, many
disk devices have built-in track buffers. No matter how small a
request you make to the drive, it always reads a full track. With
synchronous I/O, if your program makes two small requests to the same
track, and they're separated by a request for some other data, the
disk will have to read the full track twice. With asynchronous I/O, on
the other hand, the disk may be able to read the track just once, and
satisfy the second request from the track buffer.

Parrot's I/O system revolves around a request. A request has three
parts: a buffer for data, a completion routine, and a piece of data
private to the request. Your program issues the request, then goes about
its business. When the request is completed, Parrot will call the
completion routine, passing it the request that just finished. The
completion routine extracts out the buffer and the private data, and
does whatever it needs to do to handle the request. If your request
doesn't have a completion routine, then your program will have to
explicitly check to see if the request was satisfied.

Your program can choose to sleep and wait for the request to finish,
essentially blocking. Parrot will continue to process events while
your program is waiting, so it isn't completely unresponsive. This is
how Parrot implements synchronous I/O--it issues the asynchronous
request, then immediately waits for that request to complete.

The reason we made Parrot's I/O system asynchronous by default was
sheer pragmatism. Network I/O is all asynchronous, as is GUI
programming, so we knew we had to deal with asynchrony in some form.
It's also far easier to make an asynchronous system pretend to be
synchronous than it is the other way around. We could have decided to
treat GUI events, network I/O, and file I/O all separately, but there
are plenty of systems around that demonstrate what a bad idea that is.
