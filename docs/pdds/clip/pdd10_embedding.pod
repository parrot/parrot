=head1 NAME

docs/pdds/embedding.pod - Parrot's Embedding and Extending Interface

=head1 ABSTRACT

What we believe people will do when embedding and extending Parrot, why they do it, and how.

{{ NOTE: some of this will later move into pdds 11 & 12, but for now
just want to get the stub checked in. }}

=head1 VERSION

$Revision$

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Why embed:
	- access to special features/libraries/languages Parrot provides
	- need an interpreter for a DSL or existing language
	- want to run Parrot on another platform or environment (dedicated
	  hardware, in a web server, et cetera)

Why extend:
	- need something NCI doesn't provide
	- writing a custom PMC

Philosophical rules:
	- only ever use opaque pointers
	- should be able to communicate through PMCs
	- minimize conversions to and from C data
		- perhaps macros; Ruby does this fairly well and Perl 5 does this
		  poorly
		- minimize the number of necessary functions
		- probably can follow core Parrot code to some extent, but beware the
		  Perl 5 problem
			- do not expose Parrot internals that may change
			- probably includes vtable methods on PMCs

Gotchas:
	- who handles signals?
	- who owns file descriptors and other Unix resources?
	- is there an exception boundary?
	- namespace issues -- especially key related
	- probably a continuation/control flow boundary
	- packfiles and compilation units probably too much information for either
	- do not let MMD and other implementation details escape
	- okay to require some PBC/PIR/PASM for handling round-trip data
	- Parrot should not spew errors to STDERR when embedded
	- const_string() is a real pain, especially with necessary deallocation
	- should be access to Parrot's event loop when embedded
	- passing var args to Parrot subs likely painful
		- perhaps macros/functions to add parameters to call
		- build up a call signature somehow?
		- some abstraction for a call frame?

	- compiling code from a string should return the PMC Sub entry point (:main)

=head1 DEFINITIONS

Embedding - using libparrot from within another program, likely with a
C/NCI/FFI interface

Extending - writing Parrot extensions, likely through C or another language

In practice, there is little difference between the two; mostly in terms of who
has control.  The necessary interfaces should stay the same.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

Implementation details.

=head1 LANGUAGE NOTES

Notes on application to high-level languages. (optional)

=head1 ATTACHMENTS
