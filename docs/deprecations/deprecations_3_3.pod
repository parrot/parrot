=head1 NAME

docs/deprecations/deprecations_3_3.pod - Parrot Deprecations for 3.3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parrot Deprecations for 3.3.

=head2 pkg-config Support

parrot.pc will no longer be generated or installed.

=head3 Rationale

pkg-config conflicts with Parrot's installation guidelines which support
multiple simultaneous installed versions (PDD30).

As it stands, Parrot's pkg-config information has been unusable for several
years, but no one has complained, indicating that this is unused.

=head3 Replacement

Use parrot_config, which is installed with the parrot system.

The keys 'embed-cflags' and 'embed-ldflags' replace the pkg-config values of
'CFlags' and 'Libs'.
