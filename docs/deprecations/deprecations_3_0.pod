=head1 Parrot Deprecations for 3.0

=head2 PARROT_ERRORS_GLOBALS_FLAG

=head3 Description

The PARROT_ERRORS_GLOBALS_FLAG constant has been removed.

=head3 Rational

This flag does not modify the behaviour of parrot in any way.

=head3 Replacment

Remove all code attempting to set/unset this flag.

It didn't do anything anyways.

=head2 CodeString

=head3 Description

The CodeString PMC has been removed

=head3 Rational

Equivalent and more efficient functionality is available from StringBuilder.

=head3 Replacment

CodeString contains a number of convenience methods in addition to its core
functionality.

It is easier to replace these first.

=over 4

=item *

CodeString.lineof can be replaced by PGE;Util;line_number

=item *

CodeString.unique can be replaced by PGE;Util;unique, PAST;Compiler;unique, or
PAST;Compiler;uniquereg

=item *

CodeString.escape can be replaced by PGE;Util;pir_str_escape

=item *

CodeString.key can be replaced by PGE;Util;pir_key_escape

=item *

CodeString.charname_to_ord can be replaced by the find_codepoint opcode

=back

After these replacements, StringBuilder can be substituted for CodeString by
changing .emit to .append_format. append_format does not add newlines, so these
must be added to the format string.

=head2 :unique_reg PIR value flag

=head3 Description

The :unique_reg flag on registers in PIR is no longer available.

=head3 Rational

It doesn't do anything.

Also, this is a terrible way to work around register allocator failures if/when
we get a register allocator.

=head3 Replacment

    s/:unique_reg//g

=head2 .nci_call and .meth_call PIR special forms

Specifying the type of call being performed is no longer required thanks to the
magic of virtual dispatch.

=head3 Rational

They're old, crufty, and don't do anything that cannot be acheived by .call.

Except obfuscasion of course.

=head3 Replacment

Use .call. It should be a simple text replacement fix.

=head2 Indirect Register Access Ops

=head3 Description

Opcodes that access registers that are not their direct arguments are
deprecated.

Note, however, that direct arguments does include keys and pcc ops.

Ops that are known to have this behaviour are clear{i,n,s,p} and
set{i,n,s,p}_ind.

These have been removed. No other core ops are known to have this behaviour.
If you've created a dynop that has this behaviour, it and code using it is
subject to breakage without notice (we reserve the right to implement
optimizers).

=head3 Rational

They don't fit well with the level of the rest of parrot's opcodes.
They make register lifetime analysis impossible, preventing many optimizations.

=head3 Replacment

If you really are using this, rethink your code. Stop using the register frame
as an aggregate. Use an object aggregate in stead.

=head2 Exchange Op

=head3 Description

The exchange ops are deprecated.

=head3 Rational

They operate at too low a level to be useful as parrot ops.

=head3 Replacment

You aren't using this. Seriously?

    .macro xchg_int(a, b)
        $I0 = .a
        .a = .b
        .b = $I0
    .endm

=head2 PIR string literals with charset and encoding are deprecated

=head3 Description

PIR string literals of the form

    encoding:charset:"string"

are deprecated.

=head3 Rational

After the charset/encoding merge, they're unneeded.

=head3 Replacment

They can be replaced with

    encoding:"string"

The encoding should be one of the new unified encodings.

=head2 Remaining string_* functions are deprecated

=head3 Description

The string_* functions have been deprecated for a while.

The remaining functions are:

    string_make
    string_ord
    string_chr
    string_to_cstring_nullable
    string_max_bytes
    string_increment

=head3 Rational

They're old cruft.

=head3 Replacment

string_make should be replaced with Parrot_str_new_init.
You can use Parrot_find_encoding to get an encoding from a cstring.

Replace string_ord with Parrot_str_indexed.

Replace string_chr with Parrot_str_chr.

Replace string_to_cstring_nullable with Parrot_str_to_cstring.

string_max_bytes and string_increment will be removed.

=head2 Method lower in String PMC

=head3 Description

The method lower in the String PMC has been removed.

=head3 Rational

HLLs may need its own version with different name and semantic, having a
generic one is confusing. For other usages string registers are more
convenient.

=head3 Replacment

Use string registers and the downcase opcode.

For HLLs, provide its own version in the HLL mapped String type.

=cut
