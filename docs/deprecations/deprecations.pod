=head1 NAME

docs/deprecations/deprecations.pod - Parrot Deprecations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This page exists to systematically document all deprecations that apply to core
Parrot code.

We don't hate our users and while we love ripping out crufty old code, we also
don't want anyone developing code on top of Parrot to dread paying the
"upgrade tax" when moving from one supported version to the next.

The idea behind this page is that by following the instructions for each version
transition, developers of HLLs and libraries can have a well-known and
deterministic upgrade path.

Any new deprecations must be described on the appropriate page and summarized
here before being committed to master.  This deprecation policy will be
instituted shortly before the 2.6 release.

Although we will attempt to add notices for previous version transitions, these
lists may be incomplete.

Notifications for the 2.6->2.9 transition and later will be complete.

For instructions on how to deprecate Parrot code, please see:
 F<how-to-deprecate.pod>.

=head2 Changes Between 3.3 and 3.6

=over 4

=item *

Special Purpose NCI Parameter Types

- moderate impact expected:
  some NCI-using code needs to be rewritten

=back

=head2 Changes Between 3.0 and 3.3

=over 4

=item *

pkg-config Support

- low impact expected:
  feature has been unusable since at least 1.0

=head2 Changes Between 2.9 and 3.0

This list is a summary.  A more complete description and migration path for each
change is at F<deprecations_3_0.pod>.

Any deprecations occurring after the 2.9.0 release require an accompanying
notice here and F<deprecations_3_0.pod>, so the list should
be exhaustive.

If you find a deprecation that should be listed here, file a ticket
 L<https://github.com/parrot/parrot/issues/new>
or hop on #parrot on irc.parrot.org and let us know.

  Trivial change to C<concat_s_s_s>
  or slightly better solution to refactor with StringBuilder.

=head2 Changes Between 2.6 and 2.9

This list is a summary.  A more complete description and migration path for
each change is at F<deprecations_2_9.pod>.

=over 4

=item *

Remove charset opcodes. TT #1778

- low impact expected: the conversion to encoding opcodes is straightforward.


=item *

Remove ParrotPCCINVOKE.

- negligible impact expected:
  this function has been deprecated for a long time.

=item *
Remove Parrot_find_global_s and Parrot_store_global_s  TT #1660

- low impact expected: these functions were used rarely outside Parrot.

=item *

Change find_lex opcode behaviour.

- low impact expected: this function has been deprecated for awhile.

=item *

Eliminate Raw NCI.

- negligible impact expected:
  this functionality has little use that doesn't result in a segfault

=item *

Remove Parrot_get_runtime_prefix.  TT #1191

- Zero impact expected, it's been unused since long time.
=item *

RemoveIsTty Remove is_tty methods.  #1689

No replacement currently exists.  TT #633

- negligible impact expected: this op was not widely used

=item *

- moderate impact expected: simple textual substitution for C code dealing
  with STRING* values

=item *

Remove in-place substr op variants.  TT #1450

- high impact expected: most PIR code dealing with string substitution will
  need to be updated
