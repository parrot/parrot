=head1 NAME

docs/dev/profiling.pod - Profiling Parrot

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file documents the use of Parrot's profiling runcore.

=head2 Summary

The profiling runcore is built as part of Parrot and is designed to allow
discovery of bottlenecks in PIR code.  It is also being instrumented to support
HLL profiling, but this support is currently limited.  Code can be run under
the profiling runcore by passing C<-Rprofiling> or C<--runcore profiling> to
the C<parrot> binary.  The location and format of the output file are
determined by environment variables as documented below.  If the profiling
runcore does not detect any relevant environment variables, it will use the
defaults described below.

=head2 Environment Variables

=over 4

=item C<PARROT_PROFILING_FILENAME>

This determines the full name of the file where the output will be written, if
any.  Parrot does not check if the filename exists before opening it for
writing and will happily overwrite any existing files, including previous profiles.

If no value is specified, Parrot will write to a file named C<parrot.pprof.X>,
where X is the PID of the Parrot process.  When the profiling runcore exits, it
will print a message announcing where the profile was written.

This variable can also have the special values C<stdout> and C<stderr>.  When
either of these values are detected (case-insensitively), Parrot will print its
profiling output the stdout or stderr.

=item C<PARROT_PROFILING_OUTPUT>

This determines the type of output which will contain the profile.  Current
options are C<pprof> and C<none>.  C<pprof> is the default and is an
ascii-based human-readable format.  It can be post-processed into a
Callgrind-compatible format by tools/dev/pprof2cg.pl.  C<none> writes nothing
to the output file.  It is most useful for testing and optimizing the
profiling runcore itself.  It is expected to be of little interest to users
wishing to profile PIR and HLL code.

=item C<PARROT_PROFILING_ANNOTATIONS>

This determines whether PIR annotations will be recorded as part of the
profile.  Annotations are necessary when profiling HLL code, but will cause the
profiling runcore to run more slowly.  By default, they are disabled.  Set this
value to enable them.

=item C<PARROT_PROFILING_CANONICAL_OUPUT>

When this is set, the profiling runcore will record all addresses as a single
constant value and all times as 1.  This options is useful primarily for
testing, where it's helpful to have a way to ensure that a given chunk of code
will always produce exactly the same profile.  If you want this feature
enabled, you also probably want to pass a fixed hash seed to Parrot via
C<--hash-seed 1324> to avoid any non-deterministic behavior that hash seed
randomization may cause.

This variable is not useful apart from testing the profiling runcore and will
most certainly not help you find hotspots in your code.
