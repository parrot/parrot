=head1 NAME

The Headerizer

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Headerizer (F<tools/build/headerizer.pl>) is a tool that generates
chunks of F<.h> header files based on C source code.

The long-term plan for the headerizer is that it will take all
the prototypes for all the functions and populate all the .h files
automatically.  No need to worry about differences between header and
source, because the header comes from it.  It'll also auto-generate
attributes for each of the functions that work with GCC.

=head1 RUNNING THE HEADERIZER

Yesterday there was a problem where I forgot to put PARROT_EXPORT on the
function in source, so linking on Windows broke.  If that happens again,
here's what you do:

=over 4

=item * Run Configure.pl

=item * Update the source with PARROT_EXPORT above the return type

=item * Run "make headerizer"

=back

The .h file should now have PARROT_EXPORT for the function in question.
