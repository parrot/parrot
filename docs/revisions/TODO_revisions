TODO - The Task List file for Parrot's Document Revisions

This document is an overview of the tasks necessary to complete our 
revision of Parrot's Documentation Set.  Please note, by complete, we
mean a set of documents sufficient to satisfy the goals set out in 
'README_revisions.pod'.

[Open] 0.   Solicit aid!

[Done] 1.   Write a README_revision and this TODO_revision and commit them
       	    to a new documentation branch on github.

[Done] 2.   Create a new 'documentation_set' branch on github to house
       	    our revisions.

[Done] 3.   Convert 'docs.parrot.org' to Github pages.

[Open] 4.   Review and revise (i.e., correct, update, and delete, where
       	    appropriate) each and every document in the 'docs/' directory.

[Open] 5.   Add a new 'README.pod' to 'docs/', giving an overview of the 
       	    contents of each directory in 'docs/' and of the '*.pod's in
	    'docs/'.

[Open] 6.   Apply a number system to all of the docs in 'docs/' 
       	    (e.g., something similar to what we presently use in 
	    'docs/book/...'). 

[Open] 7.   Revise and update 'docs/parrot.pod'.

[Open] 8.   Add a directory structure for the new manuals.[1]

[Open] 9.   Revise the PIR book contained in 'docs/book/pir'.

[Open] 10.  Revise the PCT book contained in 'docs/book/pct'.[2]

[Open] 11.  Revise 'parrotbug' to clarify its use for documents, as well
       	    as its use for bugs (because we want folks to use 'parrotbug' to
	    inform us of any need doc changes or corrections).

[Open] 12.  Revise 'README' to,

       	    (1) reflect this revision effort;

       	    (2) instruct folks to run 'make html' and use *only* the html 
	    version of the docs, and *not* the pod docs in 'docs/';

	    (3) update 'FEEDBACK, PATCHES, etc.' section to make mention of 
	    how to report or suggest doc changes/corrections/revisions; and

	    (4) reformat the 'README' as a '*.pod'.

[Open] 13.  Revise 'docs/submissions.pod' to reflect this revision effort 
            (e.g., "How to submit bug reports, patches and new files to 
	    Parrot" out now to read something like, "How to submit bug 
	    reports, documentation changes, patches, and new files to Parrot")

[Open] 14.  Ensure all 'README's are properly formatted in '*.pod'.

[Open] 15.  Identify and archive, where appropriate, any and all obsolete 
       	    documentation (e.g., Wikibooks, Allison Randall's video
	    presentations, etc.)

[Open] 16.  Update (or subclass or clone) 'perldoc' to,

       	    (1) work more closely with Parrot's docs and

	    (2) eliminate certain Perl specific features (e.g., displaying
	    the phrase, "User Contributed Perl Documentation", at the top
	    of the page.

[Open] 17.  Write '*.pod' pages for each of the installable binaries in
       	    Parrot's distribution.
[Done] 17a. 'parrot.pod'

[Open] 18.  Write an autogen tool to run our '*.pod' pages in (17) above 
       	    through 'pod2man', converting them to '*roff' pages.

[Open] 19.  Write an autogen indexer with which to generate an easy to use 
       	    reference to Parrot's documentation.

[Open] 20.  Implementation such tools, procedures, and tests as are necessary
       	    to ensure Parrot's code documentation comports with its internal 
	    coding standards.

[Open] 21.  Create a new, friendlier front page for 'parrot.org'.

[Open] 22.  Produce a "standard" presentation on the ParrotVM. 

[Open] 23.  Develop something to help new users and developers keep track
       	    of what they've read and where they've been in 'docs/'.[3]

[Open] 24.  Implement some way to log completed revisions.[4]

[Open] 25.  Implement an html link validation system to ensure the integrity
       	    of our html links, especially to our, own documentation.

[Open] 26.  Convert 'docs.parrot.org' for all releases between 3.0.0 and 3.10.0.

[Open] 27.  Add section on languages to 'parrot.github.com', especially about
       	    winxed and nqp.

[Open] 28.  Add something, someplace about how to update 'parrot.github.com'
       	    after a new release.

[Open] 29.  Modify 'tools/docs/make_html_docs.pl' to create new docs.

Note: The above list is, by-no-means, complete.  We will add tasks (and 
      subtasks to the above tasks) as this revision effort comes more clearly
      into focus or as others make us aware of the need for additional tasks.

---------------
[1]  Note: Ensure we include, at least, a '.gitignore' in each new directory.

[2]  Note: Benabik, presently, is engaged in a rewrite of PCT, called PACT,
using the winxed programming language rather than nqp-rx or PIR.  Given this,
we will engage only in nominal, i.e., only those necessary to bring them 
up-to-date, corrections to the documents in 'docs/book/pct'.

[3]  For example, when the user fires up 'perldoc' (or our 'perldoc' clone),
it reads a DOT directory which contains the reader's document-flow.

[4]  Write (or find) something on CPAN which will log our completions to
'.parrot_revision' directory within 'docs/'.
