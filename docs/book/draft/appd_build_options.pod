=head1 Build Requirements

There are a number of requirements for building Parrot from source, and a
number of optional libraries and components that can be used to extend its
capabilities. None of these requirements or optional components are necessary
unless you are building Parrot from the source code.

=over 4

=item * C Compiler

Parrot can be built with a number of C compilers. Parrot is written using the
C89 standard, and the Parrot project officially supports the most recent
C89 compiler on major systems, including the most recent versions of Microsoft
C Compiler and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

=item * make

Make is a program to manage and automate the build process. Unix-based systems
will typically have access to the C<make> command as part of the normal
development tools. Windows systems can get the C<nmake> utility to perform the
same task.

=item * Git

Git is the source control system that is used by the Parrot project.
You need git to clone the latest version of the source code. You can
get git at L<http://git-scm.com>, or through one of the
common packaging systems.

=item * bison and flex

Bison and Flex are used to create the lexical analyzer and parser components
for the PIR compiler IMCC. These are not necessary most of the time
unless you are planning to hack on IMCC directly.

=item * ICU

ICU is a library for handling and manipulating Unicode text strings. Without
ICU libraries installed, you wont be able to use Unicode with your built
Parrot.

=item * GMP

GMP is a mathematics library for manipulating arbitrary precision and
arbitrary size numbers. GMP is an optional library used by the BigInt
and BigNum PMCs.

=item * Readline

The readline library allows some advanced behaviors on the command line such
as command history.

=item * PCRE

PCRE is a library that provides access to the Perl 5 regular expression syntax.
In order to use these regular expressions, you will want to install PCRE. To
do that on Linux you use the command:

  sudo apt-get install libpcre3-dev

=item * GDBM

=item * PQ

=back

In addition to these build requirements listed above, there are a number
of Perl libraries needed to enable the full set of tests and testing
facilities, and to generate all the necessary documentation.

To get the Perl packages for Parrot, you can use the commands:

  sudo cpan Test::Base Test::Pod Test::Pod::Coverage Pod::Spell
  sudo cpan File::HomeDir File::Which Readonly Regexp::Parser
  sudo cpan Perl::Critic Perl::Critic::Bangs Test::Perl::Critic
