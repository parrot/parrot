=head1 Getting Started

=head1 Building Parrot

Z<CHP-2-SECT-2.2.2>

X<Parrot;source code>
The first step before you start playing with Parrot is to get a copy of
the source code and compile it. You can download the latest monthly
release from U<http://www.parrot.org/release/current>.

To build Parrot you'll need a C compiler and a make utility. Generally,
you'll use F<gcc> and F<make>, but many different versions of these
tools are supported on different operation systems. Perl is also needed
for parts of the configuration and build process. The following
command-line instructions will build the core virtual machine and
compiler toolkit, and run the standard test suite.

  $ perl Configure.pl
  $ make
  $ make test

Once you've compiled Parrot, you can run your first small script. Create
a test file in the main F<parrot> directory called F<fjord.pasm>. C<.pasm>
files are written in primative Parrot Assembly Language (PASM) which is a
low-level programming interface to Parrot.

  print "He's pining for the fjords.\n"
  end

Now run this file with:

  $ ./parrot fjord.pasm

which will print:

  He's pining for the fjords.

Next, try out one of Parrot's high-level languages. Create a test file
called F<hello.nqp>:

  say "Hello, World!"

Then run it as:

  $ ./nqp hello.nqp
  
This will print, of course, the phrase "Hello, World". NQP stands for I<Not
Quite Perl>, it's a mini language that's very similar to the Perl 6 programming
language. NQP is part of the Parrot Compiler Tools (PCT) and is an integral
part of building compilers for Parrot. We will talk more about NQP and the
rest of the PCT tools, and how to use these for building compilers for Parrot
in chapter 9.

In the next few chapters we will discuss more aspects of Parrot programming
using low-level PASM language, and a higher-level interface language called
PIR. Chapters 3 and 4 will talk about PIR, which is the primary way to program
Parrot directly. Chapter 5 will talk about PASM, and the low-level programming
interface.

=head2 Build Requirements

There are a number of requirements for building Parrot from source, and a
number of optional libraries and components that can be used to extend its
capabilities. None of these requirements or optional components are necessary
unless you are building Parrot from the source code.

=over 4

=item* C Compiler

Parrot can be built with a number of C compilers. Parrot is written using the
C89 standard, and the Parrot project officially supports the most recent
C89 compiler on major systems, including the most recent versions of Microsoft
C Compiler and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

=item* make

Make is a program to manage and automate the build process. Unix-based systems
will typically have access to the C<make> command as part of the normal
development tools. Windows systems can get the C<nmake> utility to perform the
same task.

=item* Subversion

Subversion is the source control system that is used by the Parrot project.
You need subversion to checkout the latest version of the source code. You can
get subversion at L<http://subversion.tigris.org>, or through one of the
common packaging systems.

=item* bison and flex

Bison and Flex are used to create the lexical analyzer and parser components
for the PIR compilers IMCC and PIRC. These are not necessary most of the time
unless you are planning to hack on IMCC and PIRC directly.

=item* ICU

ICU is a library for handling and manipulating Unicode text strings. Without
ICU libraries installed, you wont be able to use Unicode with your built
Parrot.

=item* GMP

GMP is a mathematics library for manipulating arbitrary precision and
arbitrary size numbers. GMP is an optional library used by the BigInt
and BigNum PMCs.

=item* Readline

The readline library allows some advanced behaviors on the command line such
as command history.

=item* PCRE

PCRE is a library that provides access to the Perl 5 regular expression syntax.
In order to use these regular expressions, you will want to install PCRE. To
do that on Linux you use the command:

  sudo apt-get install libpcre3-dev

=item* GDBM

=item* PQ

=item* GLUT

GLUT is an interface to the OpenGL API. It enables programs running on Parrot
to have access to 3D graphics. To get GLUT on Linux systems you can use the
command:

  sudo apt-get install libglut3-dev

=back

In addition to these build requirements listed above, there are a number of
Perl libraries needed to enable all tests and testing facilities, and to
generate all the necessary documentation.

To get the Perl packages for Parrot, you can use the commands:

  sudo cpan Test::Base Test::Pod Test::Pod::Coverage Pod::Spell
  sudo cpan File::HomeDir File::Which Readonly Regexp::Parser
  sudo cpan Perl::Critic Perl::Critic::Bangs Test::Perl::Critic


=head3 Use the source

X<Parrot;source code>
The second step to participating in Parrot development is to get a
copy of the source code. If you just want to try it out--experiment
with a few features and see how it feels--the best option is to
download the most recent point release for your system. Point releases
are usually packaged up for easy download and install for various
platforms, including Windows, Debian, and Redhat. Point releases are
also available from CPAN. The sure way to get the most recent release is at
U<http://search.cpan.org/dist/parrot/> (or search for "parrot" in
"Distributions"). If you want something a little more cutting edge than
the packaged release, a new snapshot of the subversion repository is
created every eight hours. The most recent snapshot is always available
at U<http://cvs.perl.org/snapshots/parrot/parrot-latest.tar.gz>.

If you plan to get involved in development, you'll want to check out
the source from the subversion repository directly. Anyone can get
anonymous access to read the files and download a working copy to
explore and test. For commit access, volunteers need a
U<http://auth.perl.org> username, and need to be approved by a
Metacommitter. To download the most recent version from SVN, type this
command into your terminal N<This is for Linux users, on Mac or
Windows systems, follow the instructions from your SVN client>:

  svn co https://svn.parrot.org/parrot/trunk parrot

There's also a web interface for viewing files in the repository at
U<http://svn.parrot.org/parrot/>. 

The repository is large and complex, so it's worth taking a little bit
of time to explore. The code changes constantly, but most files and
functions have informative descriptions to help keep track of things.

The most important top-level directory is F<docs/>.  The content isn't
always up to date, but it is a good place to start. F<parrot.pod>
provides a quick overview of what's in each documentation file. If you're
a capable writer and know a thing or two about how Parrot works, the
documentation is a great place to start contributing. This book that
you're reading right now was created in F<docs/book/> by ordinary
contributors. Most other documentation files found here are parsed and
converted to HTML for display at U<http://www.parrot.org>.

The F<languages/> directory contains the code that implements various
language compilers N<This isn't entirely true. As of the 1.0 release
of Parrot, all HLLs are supposed to reside elsewhere, not in the
Parrot repository. If the languages disappear from there, we'll
probably be nice enough to leave a note telling you where it went>:
Perl 6, Python ("Pynie"), Ruby ("Cardinal"), PHP ("Pipp"), Lisp, Lua,
Tcl ("partcl"), WMLScript, Forth, Scheme, Befunge, BASIC, and many
others. These language compilers are in various stages of partial
completion. The page L<https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/Languages>
provides meta information on
the included languages and on the many language projects that are
being developed and maintained outside the Parrot repository. If you
have a language you're particularly interested to see implemented on
Parrot, you can see how far along the effort is, or you can start the
work to implement it yourself. We'll talk more about creating new
compilers in Chapter 10: High-Level Languages, if you're interested.

The F<lib/> directory contains Perl 5 classes currently used in
developing, building, and testing Parrot. The F<src/pmc/> directory
contains the C source code for Parrot classes (PMCs, which you'll read
more about in A<CHP-11>Chapter 11).

Most Parrot development happens in F<src/> for the C source code, and
F<include/parrot/> for the C development header files.

Libraries for use by programs running on Parrot are found in F<runtime/>.

The F<examples/> directory contains some example Parrot PIR and Assembly
code, as well as benchmarks. More discussions about these topics will be
found in A<CHP-3> Chapter 3, A<CHP-5> Chapter 5, and A<CHP-7> Chapter 7
respectively.
