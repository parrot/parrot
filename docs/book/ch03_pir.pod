=head1 Parrot Intermediate Representation

Z<CHP-3>

X<Parrot Intermediate Representation;;(see PIR)>
X<PIR>

Parrot Intermediate Representation (PIR) is Parrot's native low-level
language.N<Parrot also has a pure native assembly language called PASM,
described in Chapter 9.> PIR is fundamentally an assembly language, but
it has some higher-level features such as operator syntax, syntactic
sugar for subroutine and method calls, automatic register allocation,
and more friendly conditional syntax.  PIR is commonly used to write
Parrot libraries -- including some of Parrot's compilers -- and is the
target form when compiling high-level languages to Parrot.  Even so, PIR
is more rigid and "close to the machine" then some higher-level
languages like C. X<.pir files> Files containing PIR code use the
F<.pir> extension.

=head2 Basic Syntax

PIR has a relatively simple syntax. Every line is a comment, a label, a
statement, or a directive. There is no end-of-line symbol (such as a
semicolon in C), the end of the line is the end of the statement or
directive.

=head3 Comments

X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation); comments>
X<comments (PIR)>
A comment begins with the C<#> symbol, and continues until the end of the line.
Comments can stand alone on a line or follow a statement or directive.

=begin PIR

    # This is a regular comment. The PIR
    # interpreter ignores this.

=end PIR

X<Pod documentation>
PIR also treats inline documentation in Pod format as a comment. An
equals sign as the first character of a line marks the start of a Pod
block.  A C<=cut> marker signals the end of a Pod block.

  =head2

  This is Pod documentation, and is treated like a
  comment. The PIR interpreter ignores this.

  =cut

=head3 Labels

Z<CHP-3-SECT-4>

X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);labels> X<labels (PIR)> A label
attaches a name to a line of code so other statements can refer to it.
Labels can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. By convention,
labels use all capital letters to stand out from the rest of the source
code. It's fine to put a label on the same line as a statement or
directive:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    GREET: print "'Allo, 'allo, 'allo."

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Readability is improved by putting labels on separate lines, outdented
to stand apart from the ordiary code flow:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  GREET:
    print "'Allo, 'allo, 'allo."

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

=head3 Statements

Z<CHP-3-SECT-1>

X<statements (PIR)>
X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);statements>
A statement is either an opcode or syntactic sugar for one or more opcodes. An
opcode is a native instruction for the virtual machine; it consists of the name
of the instruction followed by zero or more arguments.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  print "Norwegian Blue"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

PIR also provides higher-level constructs, including symbol operators:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $I1 = 2 + 5

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Under the hood, these special statement forms are just syntactic sugar for
regular opcodes. The C<+> symbol corresponds to the C<add> opcode, the C<->
symbol to the C<sub> opcode, and so on. The previous example is equivalent to:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  add $I1, 2, 5

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

=head3 Directives

Directives look similar to opcodes, but they begin with a period (C<.>).
Parrot's parser handles them specially. Some directives specify actions
that occur at compile time. Other directives represent complex
operations that require the generation of multiple instructions.  The
C<.local> directive, for example, declares a named variable.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  .local string hello

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

=head3 Literals

Integers and floating point numbers are numeric literals. They can be positive
or negative.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $I0 = 42       # positive
  $I1 = -1       # negative

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Integer literals can also be binary or hexadecimal:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $I3 = 0b01010  # binary
  $I2 = 0xA5     # hexadecimal

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Floating point number literals have a decimal point, and can use scientific
notation:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $N0 = 3.14
  $N2 = -1.2e+4

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

X<strings;in PIR>
String literals are enclosed in single or double-quotes.N<L<Strings>
explains the differences between the quoting types.>

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $S0 = "This is a valid literal string"
  $S1 = 'This is also a valid literal string'

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

=head3 Variables

PIR variables can store four different kinds of valuesE<mdash>integers,
numbers (floating point), strings, and objects. Parrot's objects are
called PMCs, for "I<P>olyI<M>orphic I<C>ontainer".

The simplest kind of variable is a register variable. The name of a
register variable always starts with a dollar sign (C<$>), followed by a
single character which specifies the type of the variableE<mdash>integer
(C<I>), number (C<N>), string (C<S>), or PMC (C<P>)E<mdash>, and end
with a unique number. Register variables don't need to be predeclared:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $S0 = "Who's a pretty boy, then?"
  print $S0

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

PIR also has named variables, which are declared with the C<.local>
directive. As with register variables, there are four valid types:
C<int>, C<num>, C<string>, and C<pmc>. Named variables have to be
declared, but otherwise behave exactly the same as register variables.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  .local string hello
  hello = "'Allo, 'allo, 'allo."
  print hello

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

=head3 Constants

X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);constants>
X<constants (PIR)>

The C<.const> directive declares a named constant. Named constants are
similar to named variables, but their values are set in the declaration
and can never be changed. Like C<.local>, C<.const> takes a type and a
name. It also requires a literal argument to set the value of the
constant.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  .const int    frog = 4                       # integer constant
  .const string name = "Superintendent Parrot" # string constant
  .const num    pi   = 3.14159                 # floating point constant

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Named constants may be used in all the same places as literals, but have
to be declared beforehand. The following example declares a named string
constant C<hello> and prints the value:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  .const string hello = "Hello, Polly."
  print hello

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

=head3 Control Structures

Rather than providing a pre-packaged set of control structures like
C<if> and C<while>, PIR gives you the building blocks to construct your
own.N<PIR has many advanced features, but at heart it B<is> an assembly
language.> The most basic of these building blocks is C<goto>, which
jumps to a named label.N<This is not your father's C<goto>. It can only
jump inside a subroutine, and only to a named label.> In the following
code example, the C<print> statement will run immediately after the
C<goto> statement:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    goto GREET
    # ... some skipped code ...

  GREET:
    print "'Allo, 'allo, 'allo."

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Variations on the basic C<goto> check whether a particular condition is
true or false before jumping:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  if $I0 > 5 goto GREET

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

All of the traditional control structures can be constructed from PIR's
control building blocks.

=head3 Subroutines

A PIR subroutine starts with the C<.sub> directive and ends with the
C<.end> directive. Parameter declarations use the C<.param> directive,
and look a lot like named variable declarations. The following example
declares a subroutined named C<greeting>, that takes a single string
parameter named C<hello>:

=begin PIR

  .sub greeting
      .param string hello
      print hello
  .end

=end PIR

=head3 That's All Folks

You now know everything you need to know about PIR. Everything else you
read or learn about PIR will use one of these fundamental language
structures. The rest is vocabulary.

=head2 Working with Variables

We call the simple C<$I0>-style variables "register variables" for a
specific reason: Parrot is a register-based virtual machine. It has 4
typed register sets: integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and
objects. When you're working with register variables or named variables,
you're actually working directly with register storage locations in the
virtual machine.

If you've ever worked with an assembly language before, you may
immediately jump to the conclusion that C<$I0> is the zeroth integer
register, but Parrot is a bit smarter than that. The number of a
register variable usually does not correspond to the register used
internally; Parrot's compiler maps registers as appropriate for speed
and memory considerations. The only guarantee Parrot gives you is that
you'll always get the same storage location when you use C<$I0> in the
same subroutine.

The most basic operation on a variable is assignment using the C<=>
operator:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $I0 = 42        # set integer variable to the value 42
  $N3 = 3.14159   # set number variable to an approximation of pi
  $I1 = $I0       # set $I1 to the value of $I0

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The C<exchange> opcode swaps the contents of two variables of the same
type. The following example sets C<$I0> to the value of C<$I1>, and sets
C<$I1> to the value of C<$I0>. 

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  exchange $I0, $I1

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The C<null> opcode sets an integer or number variable to a zero value,
and undefines a string or object.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  null $I0  # 0
  null $N0  # 0.0
  null $S0  # NULL
  null $P0  # PMCNULL

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

=head2 Working with Numbers

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);math operations>
PIR has an extensive set of math instructions that work with integers,
floating-point numbers, and numeric PMCs. Many of the math instructions
have two- and three-argument forms:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $I10 = $I11 + $I2
  $I0 += $I1

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The three-argument form of C<+> stores the sum
of the two arguments in the result variable. The two-argument form
adds the first variable to the second and stores the result back in
the first variable.

The arguments can be Parrot variables or constants, but they
must be compatible with the type of the result.
Generally, "compatible" means that the result and arguments have to
be the same type, but there are a few exceptions:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $P0 = $P1 - 2
  $P0 = $P1 - 1.5

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

If the result is an integer type, like C<$I0>, the arguments must be
integer variables or constants. A
floating-point result, like C<$N0>, usually requires
floating-point arguments, but many math instructions also allow the final
argument to be an integer. Instructions with a PMC result may
accept an integer, floating-point, or PMC final argument:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  mul $P0, $P1             # $P0 *= $P1
  mul $P0, $I1
  mul $P0, $N1
  mul $P0, $P1, $P2        # $P0 = $P1 * $P2
  mul $P0, $P1, $I2
  mul $P0, $P1, $N2

=end PIR_FRAGMENT



We won't list every math opcode here, but we'll list some of the most common
ones. You can get a complete list in "PIR Opcodes" in Chapter 11.

=head4 Unary math opcodes

Z<CHP-9-SECT-2.3.1>

The unary opcodes have either a destination argument and a source
argument, or a single argument as destination and source. Some of the
most common unary math opcodes are C<inc> (increment), C<dec>
(decrement), C<abs> (absolute value), C<neg> (negate), and C<fact>
(factorial):

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  abs $N0, -5.0  # the absolute value of -5.0 is 5.0
  fact $I1, 5    # the factorial of 5 is 120
  inc $I1        # 120 incremented by 1 is 121

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

=head4 Binary math opcodes

Z<CHP-9-SECT-2.3.2>

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);math operations;binary>
Binary opcodes have two source arguments and a destination argument, and we
saw examples of these types above. As we mentioned before, most binary math
opcodes have a two-argument form in which the first argument is both a source
and the destination. Parrot provides C<add>X<add opcode (PIR)> (addition),
C<sub>X<sub opcode (PIR)> (subtraction), C<mul>X<mul opcode (PIR)>
(multiplication), C<div>X<div opcode (PIR)> (division), and C<pow>X<pow
opcode (PIR)> (exponent) opcodes, as well as two different modulus
operations. C<mod>X<mod opcode (PIR)> is Parrot's implementation of modulus,
and C<cmod>X<cmod opcode (PIR)> performs an operation equivalent the C<%>
operator from the C programming language. It also provides C<gcd>X<gcd opcode
(PIR)> (greatest common divisor) and C<lcm>X<lcm opcode (PIR)> (least common
multiple).

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  div $I0, 12, 5   # $I0 = 12 / 5
  mod $I0, 12, 5   # $I0 = 12 % 5

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

=head4 Floating-point operations

Z<CHP-9-SECT-2.3.3>

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);math operations;floating-point>
Although most of the math operations work with both floating-point numbers
and integers, a few require floating-point destination registers. Among these
are C<ln> (natural log), C<log2> (log base 2), C<log10> (log base 10), and
C<exp> (I<e>G<x>), as well as a full set of trigonometric opcodes such as
C<sin> (sine), C<cos> (cosine), C<tan> (tangent), C<sec> (secant), C<cosh>
(hyperbolic cosine), C<tanh> (hyperbolic tangent), C<sech> (hyperbolic secant),
C<asin> (arc sine), C<acos> (arc cosine), C<atan> (arc tangent), C<asec> (arc
secant), C<exsec> (exsecant), C<hav> (haversine), and C<vers> (versine). All
angle arguments for the X<trigonometric functions (PIR)> trigonometric
functions are in radians:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  sin $N1, $N0
  exp $N1, 2

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The majority of the floating-point operations have a single source argument
and a single destination argument. Even though the destination must be a
floating-point register, the source can be either an integer or floating-point
number.

The C<atan>X<atan opcode (PIR)> opcode also has a three-argument variant that
implements C's C<atan2()>:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  atan $N0, 1, 1

=end PIR_FRAGMENT




=head2 Working with Strings

Strings in double-quotes accept all sorts of escape sequences using
backslashes. Strings in single-quotes only allow escapes for nested
quotes:

  $S0 = "This string is \n on two lines"
  $S0 = 'This is a \n one-line string with a slash in it'

Parrot supports several escape sequences in double-quoted strings:

  \xhh        1..2 hex digits
  \ooo        1..3 oct digits
  \cX         Control char X
  \x{h..h}    1..8 hex digits
  \uhhhh      4 hex digits
  \Uhhhhhhhh  8 hex digits
  \a          An ASCII alarm character
  \b          An ASCII backspace character
  \t          A tab
  \n          A newline
  \v          A vertical tab
  \f
  \r
  \e
  \\          A backslash
  \"          A quote

If you need more flexibility in defining a string, use a X<heredoc string
literal>.  The C<E<lt>E<lt>> operator starts a heredoc.  The string terminator
immediately follows.  All text until the terminator is part of the heredoc.
The terminator must appear on its own line, must appear at the beginning of the
line, and may not have any trailing whitespace.

  $S2 = << "End_Token"

  This is a multi-line string literal. Notice that
  it doesn't use quotation marks.

  End_Token

=head3 Assignment

Strings in Parrot are also stored as references to internal data structures
like PMCs. However, strings use Copy-On-Write (COW) optimizations. When we
call C<set S1, S0> we copy the pointer only, so both registers point to the
same string memory. We don't actually make a copy of the string until one of
two registers is modified. Here's the same example using string registers
instead of PMC registers, which demonstrate how strings use COW:

=begin PASM

  set S0, "Ford"
  set S1, S0
  set S1, "Zaphod"
  print S0                # prints "Ford"
  print S1                # prints "Zaphod"
  end

=end PASM

Here, we can clearly see the opposite result from how PMCs were handled in
the previous example. Modifying one of the two registers causes a new string
to be created, preserving the old value in C<S0> and assigning the new value
to the new string in C<S1>. The benefits here are that we don't have to worry
about stray references causing side effects in our code, and we don't waste
time copying a string until it's actually time to make a copy.


Strings are buffers of variable-sized data. The most common use of string
registers and variables is to store textual data. String registers I<may> also be
buffers for binary or other non-textual data, though this is rareN<In general,
a custom PMC is more useful>.  Parrot strings are flexible and powerful, to
account for all the complexity of human-readable (and computer-representable)
textual data.

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);string operations>
String operations work with string registers and string-like PMCs.
String operations on PMC registers require all their string
arguments to be String PMCs.

=head4 Concatenating strings

Z<CHP-9-SECT-2.4.1>

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);string operations;concatenation>
Use the C<concat>X<concat opcode (PIR)> opcode to concatenate
strings. With string register or string constant arguments, C<concat>
has both a two-argument and a three-argument form. The first argument
is a source and a destination in the two-argument form:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  set $S0, "ab"
  concat $S0, "cd"     # S0 has "cd" appended
  print $S0            # prints "abcd"
  print "\n"

  concat $S1, $S0, "xy" # S1 is the string S0 with "xy" appended
  print $S1            # prints "abcdxy"
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The first C<concat> concatenates the string "cd" onto the string "ab" in
C<S0>. It generates a new string "abcd" and changes C<S0> to point to the
new string. The second C<concat> concatenates "xy" onto the string "abcd"
in C<S0> and stores the new string in C<S1>.

X<PMCs (Polymorphic Containers);concatenation>
For PMC registers, C<concat> has only a three-argument form with
separate registers for source and destination:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  new $P0, "String"
  new $P1, "String"
  new $P2, "String"
  set $P0, "ab"
  set $P1, "cd"
  concat $P2, $P0, $P1
  print $P2            # prints abcd
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Here, C<concat> concatenates the strings in C<$P0> and C<$P1> and stores
the result in C<$P2>.

=head4 Repeating strings

Z<CHP-9-SECT-2.4.2>

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);string operations;repeating strings>
The C<repeat>X<repeat opcode (PIR)> opcode repeats a string a certain
number of times:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  set $S0, "x"
  repeat $S1, $S0, 5  # $S1 = $S0 x 5
  print $S1          # prints "xxxxx"
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

In this example, C<repeat> generates a new string with "x" repeated
five times and stores a pointer to it in C<S1>.

=head4 Length of a string

Z<CHP-9-SECT-2.4.3>

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);string operations;length>
The C<length>X<length opcode (PIR)> opcode returns the length of a
string in characters. This won't be the same as the length in bytes
for multibyte encoded strings:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  set $S0, "abcd"
  length $I0, $S0                # the length is 4
  print $I0
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

C<length> doesn't have an equivalent for PMC strings.

=head4 Substrings

Z<CHP-9-SECT-2.4.4>

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);string operations;substrings>
The simplest version of the C<substr>X<substr opcode (PIR)> opcode
takes four arguments: a destination register, a string, an offset
position, and a length. It returns a substring of the original string,
starting from the offset position (0 is the first character) and
spanning the length:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  substr $S0, "abcde", 1, 2        # $S0 is "bc"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This example extracts a two-character string from "abcde" at a
one-character offset from the beginning of the string (starting with
the second character). It generates a new string, "bc", in the
destination register C<S0>.

When the offset position is negative, it counts backward from the end
of the string. So an offset of -1 starts at the last character of the
string.

C<substr> also has a five-argument form, where the fifth argument is a
string to replace the substring. This modifies the second argument and
returns the removed substring in the destination register.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  set $S1, "abcde"
  substr $S0, $S1, 1, 2, "XYZ"
  print $S0                        # prints "bc"
  print "\n"
  print $S1                        # prints "aXYZde"
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This replaces the substring "bc" in C<S1> with the string "XYZ", and
returns "bc" in C<S0>.

When the offset position in a replacing C<substr> is one character
beyond the original string length, C<substr> appends the replacement
string just like the C<concat> opcode. If the replacement string is an
empty string, the characters are just removed from the original
string.

When you don't need to capture the replaced string, there's an
optimized version of C<substr> that just does a replace without
returning the removed substring.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  set $S1, "abcde"
  substr $S1, 1, 2, "XYZ"
  print $S1                        # prints "aXYZde"
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The PMC versions of C<substr> are not yet implemented.

=head4 Chopping strings

Z<CHP-9-SECT-2.4.5>

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);string operations;chopping strings>
The C<chopn>X<chopn opcode (PIR)> opcode removes characters from the
end of a string. It takes two arguments: the string to modify and the
count of characters to remove.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  set $S0, "abcde"
  chopn $S0, 2
  print $S0         # prints "abc"
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This example removes two characters from the end of C<S0>. If the
count is negative, that many characters are kept in the string:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  set $S0, "abcde"
  chopn $S0, -2
  print $S0         # prints "ab"
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This keeps the first two characters in C<S0> and removes the rest.
C<chopn> also has a three-argument version that stores the chopped
string in a separate destination register, leaving the original string
untouched:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  set $S0, "abcde"
  chopn $S1, $S0, 1
  print $S1         # prints "abcd"
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

=head4 Copying and Cloning

Z<CHP-9-SECT-2.4.6>

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);string operations;copying> The C<clone>
X<clone opcode (PIR)> opcode makes a deep copy of a string or PMC. Earlier
in this chapter we saw that PMC and String values used with the C<set> opcode
didn't create a copy of the underlying data structure, it only created
a copy of the reference to that structure. With strings, this doesn't cause
a problem because strings use Copy On Write (COW) semantics to automatically
create a copy of the string when one reference is modified. However, as we
saw, PMCs don't have this same behavior and so making a change to one PMC
reference would modify the data that all the other references to that same
PMC pointed to.

Instead of just copying the pointer like C<set> would do, we can use the
C<clone> opcode to create a I<deep copy> of the PMC, not just a I<shallow
copy> of the reference.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  new $P0, "String"
  set $P0, "Ford"
  clone $P1, $P0
  set $P0, "Zaphod"
  print $P0        # prints "Zaphod"
  print $P1        # prints "Ford"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This example creates an identical, independent clone of the PMC in
C<P0> and puts a pointer to it in C<P1>. Later changes to C<P0> have
no effect on the PMC referenced in C<P1>.

With simple strings, the copes created by C<clone> are COW exactly the same
as the copy created by C<set>, so there is no difference between these two
opcodes for strings. By convention, C<set> is used with strings more often
then C<clone>, but there is no rule about this.

=head4 Converting characters

Z<CHP-9-SECT-2.4.7>

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);string operations;converting strings>
The C<chr>X<chr opcode (PIR)> opcode takes an integer value and returns the
corresponding character in the ASCII character set as a one-character string,
while the C<ord>X<ord opcode (PIR)> opcode takes a single character string
and returns the integer value of the character at the first position in the
string. Notice that the integer value of the character will differ depending
on the current encoding of the string:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  chr $S0, 65                # $S0 is "A"
  ord $I0, $S0               # $I0 is 65, if $S0 is ASCII or UTF-8

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

C<ord> has a three-argument variant that takes a character offset to select
a single character from a multicharacter string. The offset must be within
the length of the string:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  ord $I0, "ABC", 2        # $I0 is 67

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

A negative offset counts backward from the end of the string, so -1 is
the last character.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  ord $I0, "ABC", -1        # $I0 is 67

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

=head4 Formatting strings

Z<CHP-9-SECT-2.4.8>

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);string operations;formatting strings>
The C<sprintf>X<sprintf opcode (PIR)> opcode generates a formatted string
from a series of values. It takes three arguments: the destination register,
a string specifying the format, and an ordered aggregate PMC (like an
C<Array> PMC) containing the values to be formatted. The format string and
the destination register can be either strings or PMCs:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  sprintf $S0, $S1, $P2
  sprintf $P0, $P1, $P2

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The format string is similar to the one for C's C<sprintf> function,
but with some extensions for Parrot data types. Each format field in
the string starts with a C<%>
X<% (percent sign);% format strings for sprintf opcode (PIR)> and
ends with a character specifying the output format. The output format
characters are listed in Table 9-1.

The values in the aggregate PMC must have a type compatible with the

Here's a short illustration of string formats:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  new $P2, "Array"
  new $P0, "Int"
  set $P0, 42
  push $P2, $P0
  new $P1, "Num"
  set $P1, 10
  push $P2, $P1
  sprintf $S0, "int %#Px num %+2.3Pf\n", $P2
  print $S0     # prints "int 0x2a num +10.000"
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The first eight lines create a C<Array> with two elements: a
C<Int> and a C<Num>. The format string of the C<sprintf> has
two format fields. The first, C<%#Px>, takes a PMC argument from the
aggregate (C<P>) and formats it as a hexadecimal integer (C<x>), with
a leading 0x (C<#>). The second format field, C<%+2.3Pf>, takes a PMC
argument (C<P>) and formats it as a floating-point number (C<f>), with
a minimum of two whole digits and a maximum of three decimal places
(C<2.3>) and a leading sign (C<+>).

The test files F<t/op/string.t> and F<t/src/sprintf.t> have many more
examples of format strings.

=head4 Testing for substrings

Z<CHP-9-SECT-2.4.9>

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);string operations;testing for substrings>
The C<index>X<index opcode (PIR)> opcode searches for a substring
within a string. If it finds the substring, it returns the position
where the substring was found as a character offset from the beginning
of the string. If it fails to find the substring, it returns -1:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  index $I0, "Beeblebrox", "eb"
  print $I0                       # prints 2
  print "\n"
  index $I0, "Beeblebrox", "Ford"
  print $I0                       # prints -1
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

C<index> also has a four-argument version, where the fourth argument
defines an offset position for starting the search:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  index $I0, "Beeblebrox", "eb", 3
  print $I0                         # prints 5
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This finds the second "eb" in "Beeblebrox" instead of the first,
because the search skips the first three characters in the
string.

=head4 Joining strings

The C<join> opcode joins the elements of an array PMC into a single
string. The second argument separates the individual elements of the
PMC in the final string result.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  new $P0, "Array"
  push $P0, "hi"
  push $P0, 0
  push $P0, 1
  push $P0, 0
  push $P0, "parrot"
  join $S0, "__", $P0
  print $S0              # prints "hi__0__1__0__parrot"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This example builds a C<Array> in C<P0> with the values C<"hi">,
C<0>, C<1>, C<0>, and C<"parrot">. It then joins those values (separated
by the string C<"__">) into a single string, and stores it in C<S0>.

=head4 Splitting strings

Splitting a string yields a new array containing the resulting
substrings of the original string.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  split $P0, "", "abc"
  set $P1, $P0[0]
  print $P1              # 'a'
  set $P1, $P0[2]
  print $P1              # 'c'

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This example splits the string "abc" into individual characters and
stores them in an array in C<P0>. It then prints out the first and
third elements of the array. For now, the split pattern (the second
argument to the opcode) is ignored except for a test to make sure that
its length is zero.

=head3 Logical and Bitwise Operations

Z<CHP-9-SECT-2.6>

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);bitwise operations>
X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);logical operations>
The X<logical opcodes> logical opcodes evaluate the truth of their
arguments. They're often used to make decisions on control flow.
Logical operations are implemented for integers and PMCs. Numeric
values are false if they're 0, and true otherwise. Strings are false
if they're the empty string or a single character "0", and true
otherwise. PMCs are true when their
C<get_bool>X<get_bool vtable method (PIR)> vtable method returns a
nonzero value.

The C<and>X<and opcode (PIR)> opcode returns the second argument if
it's false and the third argument otherwise:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  and $I0, 0, 1  # returns 0
  and $I0, 1, 2  # returns 2

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The C<or>X<or opcode (PIR)> opcode returns the second argument if
it's true and the third argument otherwise:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  or $I0, 1, 0  # returns 1
  or $I0, 0, 2  # returns 2

  or $P0, $P1, $P2

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Both C<and> and C<or> are short-circuiting. If they can determine what
value to return from the second argument, they'll never evaluate the
third.  This is significant only for PMCs, as they might have side
effects on evaluation.

The C<xor>X<xor opcode (PIR)> opcode returns the second argument if
it is the only true value, returns the third argument if it is the
only true value, and returns false if both values are true or both are
false:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  xor $I0, 1, 0  # returns 1
  xor $I0, 0, 1  # returns 1
  xor $I0, 1, 1  # returns 0
  xor $I0, 0, 0  # returns 0

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The C<not>X<not opcode (PIR)> opcode returns a true value when the
second argument is false, and a false value if the second argument is
true:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  not $I0, $I1
  not $P0, $P1

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The X<bitwise;opcodes (PIR)> bitwise opcodes operate on their values
a single bit at a time. C<band>X<band opcode (PIR)>,
C<bor>X<bor opcode (PIR)>, and C<bxor>X<bxor opcode (PIR)> return a
value that is the logical AND, OR, or XOR of each bit in the source
arguments. They each take a destination register and two source
registers. They also have two-argument forms where the destination is
also a source.  C<bnot>X<bnot opcode (PIR)> is the logical NOT of
each bit in a single source argument.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  bnot $I0, $I1
  band $P0, $P1
  bor $I0, $I1, $I2
  bxor $P0, $P1, $I2

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

X<bitwise;string opcodes>
The bitwise opcodes also have string variants for AND, OR, and XOR:
C<bors>X<bors opcode (PIR)>, C<bands>X<bands opcode (PIR)>, and
C<bxors>X<bxors opcode (PIR)>. These take string register or PMC
string source arguments and perform the logical operation on each byte
of the strings to produce the final string.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  bors $S0, $S1
  bands $P0, $P1
  bors $S0, $S1, $S2
  bxors $P0, $P1, $S2

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The bitwise string opcodes only have meaningful results when they're
used with simple ASCII strings because the bitwise operation is done
per byte.

The logical and arithmetic shift operations shift their values by a
specified number of bits:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  shl  $I0, $I1, $I2        # shift I1 left by count I2 giving I0
  shr  $I0, $I1, $I2        # arithmetic shift right
  lsr  $P0, $P1, $P2        # logical shift right

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

=head3 Encodings and Charsets

X<charset>
A modern string system must manage several character encodings and charsets in
order to make sense out of all the string data in the world.  Parrot does this.
Every string has an associated encoding and an associated character set.  The
default charset is 8-bit ASCII, which is simple to use and is almost
universally supported.

Double-quoted string constants can have an optional prefix specifying the the
string's encoding and charsetN<As you might suspect, single-quoted strings do
not support this.>. Parrot will maintain these values internally, and will
automatically convert strings when necessary to preserve the information.
String prefixes are specified as C<encoding:charset:> at the front of the
string. Here are some examples:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $S0 = utf8:unicode:"Hello UTF8 Unicode World!"
  $S1 = utf16:unicode:"Hello UTF16 Unicode World!"
  $S2 = ascii:"This is 8-bit ASCII"
  $S3 = binary:"This is raw, unformatted binary data"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The C<binary:> charset treats the string as a buffer of raw unformatted binary
data. It isn't really a string per se, because binary data contains no readable
characters.  As mentioned earlier, this exists to support libraries which
manipulate binary data that doesn't easily fit into any other primitive data
type.

When Parrot combines two strings (such as through concatenation), they must
both use the same character set and encoding.  Parrot will automatically
upgrade one or both of the strings to use the next highest compatible format as
necessary. ASCII strings will automatically upgrade to UTF-8 strings if needed,
and UTF-8 will upgrade to UTF-16. All of these conversions happen inside
Parrot; you the programmer don't need to worry about the details.

=head2 Working with PMCs

Polymorphic Containers (PMCs) are the basis for complex data types and
object-oriented behavior in Parrot. In PIR, any variable that isn't a
low-level integer, number, or string is a PMC

Operations on a PMC are implemented by vtable functions. The result of
an operation is entirely determined by the behavior of
the PMCs vtable. Since PMCs define their own behavior for these vtable
functions, it's important to familiarize yourself with the behavior
of the particular PMC before you start performing a lot of operations on it.

=head3 Assignment

PMC registers contain references to PMC structures internally. So, the set
opcode doesn't copy the entire PMC, it only copies the reference to the
PMC data. Here's an example that shows a side effect of this operation:

=begin PASM

  new P0, "String"
  set P0, "Ford"
  set P1, P0
  set P1, "Zaphod"
  print P0                # prints "Zaphod"
  print P1                # prints "Zaphod"
  end

=end PASM

In this example, both C<P0> and C<P1> are both references to the same
internal data structure, so when we set C<P1> to the string literal
C<"Zaphod">, it overwrites the previous value C<"Ford">. Now, both C<P0>
and C<P1> point to the String PMC C<"Zaphod">, even though it appears that
we only set one of those two registers to that value.

=head4 PMC object types

Z<CHP-9-SECT-2.2.2>

X<PMCs (Polymorphic Containers);object types>
Every PMC has a distinct type that determines its behavior through the
vtable interface. In the chapter on PIR, we've seen a number of these vtable
functions already, and seen how they implement the behaviors found inside
the various opcodes. The vtable interface is standard, and all PMCs implement
the exact same set of vtables. We've seen some of the vtables and their uses,
and more of them will be discussed in this chapter and later in the various
reference chapters.

The C<typeof> opcode can be used to determine the type of a PMC. When
the source argument is a PMC and the destination is a string register,
C<typeof> returns the name of the type:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  new $P0, "String"
  typeof $S0, $P0               # $S0 is "String"
  print $S0
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Using C<typeof> with a PMC output parameter instead, it returns the Class
PMC for that type.



=head3 Scalars

Parrot provides a set of

In most of the examples we've shown so far, X<PMCs (Polymorphic
Containers);working with> PMCs just duplicate the functionality of integers,
numbers, and strings.

PMCs act much like any integer, floating-point
number, or string register or variable, but you have to instantiate a
new PMC object into a type before you use it. The C<new> instruction creates
a new PMC of the specified type:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $P0 = new 'String'
  $P0 = "That's a bollard and not a parrot."
  print $P0

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This example creates a C<String> object, stores it in the PMC register variable C<$P0>,
assigns it the value "Hello, Polly.", and prints it:

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

  .local pmc hello    # or .local pmc hello
  hello = new 'String'
  hello = "Hello, Polly."
  print hello

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

PIR is a dynamic language; that dynamicism is evident in how Parrot handles PMC
values. Primitive registers like strings, numbers, and integers perform a
special action called X<autoboxing> when assigned to a PMC. Autoboxing is the
process of converting a primitive type to a PMC object.  PMC classes exist for
String, Number, and Integer; notice that the primitive types are in lower-case,
while the PMC classes are capitalized. If you want to box a value explicitly,
use the C<box> opcode:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $P0 = new 'Integer'       # The boxed form of int
  $P0 = box 42
  $P1 = new 'Number'        # The boxed form of num
  $P1 = box 3.14
  $P2 = new 'String'        # The boxed form of string
  $P2 = "This is a string!"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The PMC classes C<Integer>, C<Number>, and C<String> are thin overlays on the
primitive types they represent. These PMC types have the benefit of the
X<PMC;VTABLE Interface> VTABLE interface. VTABLEs are a standard API that all
PMCs conform to for performing standard operations. These PMC types support
custom methods to perform various operations, may be passed to subroutines that
expect PMC arguments, and can be subclassed by a user-defined type.


PMCs are are polymorphic data items that
can be one of a large variety of predefined types. As we have seen briefly,
and as we will see in more depth later, PMCs have a standard interface called
the VTABLE interface. VTABLEs are a standard list of functions that all PMCs
implement N<or, PMCs can choose not to implement each interface explicitly and
instead let Parrot call the default implementations>.

VTABLEs are very strict: There are a fixed number with fixed names and
fixed argument lists. You can't just create any random VTABLE interface that
you want to create, you can only make use of the ones that Parrot supplies
and expects. To circumvent this limitation, PMCs may have METHODS in
addition to VTABLEs. METHODs are arbitrary code functions that can be
written in C, may have any name, and may implement any behavior.

=head4 Boxing and Unboxing

Z<CHP-9-SECT-2.2.3>

As we've seen in the previous chapters about PIR, we can convert between
primitive string, integer, and number types and PMCs. PIR used the C<=>
operator to make these conversions. PIR uses the C<set> opcode to do the
same thing. C<set> will perform the type conversions for us automatically,
in a process called I<autoboxing>.

Assigning a primitive data type to a PMC of a String, Integer, or Float type
converts that PMC to the new type. So, assigning a string to a Number PMC
converts it into a String PMC. Assigning an integer value converts it to a
C<Integer>, and assigning C<undef> converts it to an C<Undef> PMC:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  new $P0, "String"
  set $P0, "Ford\n"
  print $P0           # prints "Ford\n"
  set $P0, 42
  print $P0           # prints 42
  print "\n"
  typeof $S0, $P0
  print $S0           # prints "Integer"
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

C<P0> starts as a C<String>, but when C<set> assigns it an integer
value 42 (replacing the old string value C<"Ford">), it changes type
to C<Integer>. This behavior only works for the wrapper PMC types for the
primitive values string, int, and num. Other PMC classes will have different
behaviors when you try to assign a primitive value to them.

We can also use the C<box> opcode to explicitly convert an integer, a float,
or a string into an appropriate PMC type.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  box $P0, 3
  typeof $S0, $P0         # $P0 is an "Integer"
  box $P1, "hello"
  typeof $S0, $P1         # $P1 is a "String"
  box $P2, 3.14
  typeof $S0, $P2         # $P2 is a "Number"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT


=head3 Aggregates

Z<CHP-9-SECT-3.1>

PMCs can define complex types that hold multiple values. These are
commonly called "X<PMCs (Polymorphic Containers);aggregate>
X<aggregate PMCs> aggregates." The most important feature added for
aggregates is keyed access. Elements within an aggregate PMC can be
stored and retrieved by a numeric or string key. PIR also offers a
full set of operations for manipulating aggregate data types.

Two of the most basic aggregate types are arrays and hashes. The primary
difference between these two is that arrays are indexed using integer keys,
and hashes are indexed with string keys. The term "hash" in this context is
derived from the data type in Perl 5 of the same name. Other programming
languages might refer to the same concept using different terms such as
"dictionary" or "hash table" or "associative array".

Arrays and hashes are not the only types of aggregates available, although
they are the most simple demonstrations of using integer and strings as
keys in an aggregate, respectively.

=head4 Arrays

Z<CHP-9-SECT-3.1.1>

X<arrays>
The C<Array>X<Array PMC> PMC is an ordered aggregate with zero-based integer
keys. The syntax for X<keyed access to PMCs> keyed access to a PMC puts the
key in square brackets after the register name:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  new $P0, "Array"     # obtain a new array object
  set $P0, 2           # set its length
  set $P0[0], 10       # set first element to 10
  set $P0[1], $I31     # set second element to $I31
  set $I0, $P0[0]      # get the first element
  set $I1, $P0         # get array length

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

A key on the destination register of a C<set> operation sets a value
for that key in the aggregate. A key on the source register of a
C<set> returns the value for that key. If you set C<P0> without a key,
you set the length of the array, not one of its values.N<C<Array>
is an autoextending array, so you never need to set its length. Other
array types may require the length to be set explicitly.> And if you
assign the C<Array> to an integer, you get the length of the
array.

We mention "other array types" above, not as a vague suggestion that there may
be other types of arrays eventually, but as an indication that we actually
have several types of array PMCs in Parrot's core. Parrot comes with
C<FixedPMCArray>, C<ResizablePMCArray>, C<FixedIntegerArray>,
C<ResizableIntegerArray>, C<FixedFloatArray>, C<ResizableFloatArray>,
C<FixedStringArray>, C<ResizableStringArray>, C<FixedBooleanArray>,
and C<ResizableBooleanArray> types. These various types of arrays use
various packing methods to create higher memory efficiency for their contents
then using a single generic array type would be able to. The trade-off for
higher memory efficiency is that these array PMCs can only hold a single type
of data.

The array PMC types that start with "Fixed" have a fixed size and do not
automatically extend themselves if you attempt to add data to a higher index
then the array contains. The "Resizable" variants will automatically extend
themselves as more data are added, but the cost is in algorithmic complexity
of checking array bounds and reallocating array memory.

To retrieve the number of items currently in an array, you can use the
C<elements> opcode.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  set $P0, 100         # allocate store for 100 elements
  set $I0, $P0          # obtain current allocation size
  elements $I0, $P0     # get element count

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Some other useful instructions for working with arrays are C<push>,
C<pop>, C<shift>, and C<unshift> (you'll find them in
"PIR Opcodes" in Chapter 11).

=head4 Hashes

Z<CHP-9-SECT-3.1.2>

X<PMCs (Polymorphic Containers);hashes>
The C<Hash>X<Hash PMC> PMC is an unordered aggregate which uses string keys
to identify elements within it.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  new $P1, "Hash"      # generate a new hash object
  set $P1["key"], 10   # set key and value
  set $I0, $P1["key"]   # obtain value for key
  set $I1, $P1          # number of entries in hash

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The C<exists>X<exists opcode (PIR)> opcode tests whether a keyed
value exists in an aggregate. It returns 1 if it finds the key in the
aggregate, and returns 0 if it doesn't. It doesn't care if the value
itself is true or false, only that the key has been set:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  new $P0, "Hash"
  set $P0["key"], 0
  exists $I0, $P0["key"] # does a value exist at "key"
  print $I0             # prints 1
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The C<delete>X<delete opcode (PIR)> opcode is also useful for working
with hashes: it removes a key/value pair.

=head4 Iterators

Z<CHP-9-SECT-3.1.3>

Iterators extract values from an aggregate PMC one at a time and without
extracting duplicates. Iterators are most useful in loops where an action
needs to be performed on every element in an aggregate. You create an
iterator by creating a new C<Iterator> PMC, and passing the aggregate PMC
to C<new> as an additional parameter:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  new $P1, "Iterator", $P2

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Alternatively, you can use the C<iter> opcode to do the same thing:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  iter $P1, $P2     # Same!

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The include file F<iterator.pasm> defines some constants for working
with iterators. The C<.ITERATE_FROM_START> and C<.ITERATE_FROM_END>
constants are used to select whether an array iterator starts from the
beginning or end of the array. Since Hash PMCs are unordered, these two
constants do not have any affect on Hash iterators.

A value can be extracted from the iterator using the C<shift> opcode.
Evaluating the iterator PMC as a boolean returns whether the iterator has
reached the end of the aggregate or not.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  .include "iterator.pasm"
      new $P2, "Array"
      push $P2, "a"
      push $P2, "b"
      push $P2, "c"
      new $P1, "Iterator", $P2
      set $P1, .ITERATE_FROM_START

  iter_loop:
      unless $P1, iter_end
      shift $P5, $P1
      print $P5                        # prints "a", "b", "c"
      branch iter_loop
  iter_end:
      # ...

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Hash iterators work similarly to array iterators, but they extract keys
only. With the key, you can find it's value from the original hash PMC.
With hashes it's only meaningful to iterate in one direction since they
don't define any order for their keys.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

=head4 Data structures

Z<CHP-9-SECT-3.1.4>

X<PMCs (Polymorphic Containers);data structures>
Arrays and hashes can hold any data type, including other aggregates.
Accessing elements deep within nested data structures is a common
operation, so PIR provides a way to do it in a single instruction.
Complex keys specify a series of nested data structures, with each
individual key separated by a semicolon:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  new $P0, "Hash"
  new $P1, "Array"
  set $P1[2], 42
  set $P0["answer"], $P1
  set $I1, 2
  set $I0, $P0["answer";$I1]        # $i = %hash{"answer"}[2]
  print $I0
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This example builds up a data structure of a hash containing an array.
The complex key C<P0["answer";I1]> retrieves an element of the array
within the hash. You can also set a value using a complex key:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  set $P0["answer";0], 5   # %hash{"answer"}[0] = 5

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The individual keys are integers or strings, or registers with integer
or string values.

=head3 PMC Assignment

Z<CHP-9-SECT-3.2>

We mentioned before that C<set> on two X<PMCs (Polymorphic
Containers);assignment> PMCs simply aliases them both to the same object,
and that C<clone> creates a complete duplicate object. But if you just
want to assign the value of one PMC to another PMC, you need the
C<assign>X<assign opcode (PIR)> opcode:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  new $P0, "Int"
  new $P1, "Int"
  set $P0, 42
  set $P2, $P0
  assign $P1, $P0     # note: $P1 has to exist already
  inc $P0
  print $P0          # prints 43
  print "\n"
  print $P1          # prints 42
  print "\n"
  print $P2          # prints 43
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This example creates two C<Int> PMCs: C<P0> and C<P1>. It gives
C<P0> a value of 42. It then uses C<set> to give the same value to
C<P2>, but uses C<assign> to give the value to C<P1>. When C<P0> is
incremented, C<P2> also changes, but C<P1> doesn't. The destination
register for C<assign> must have an existing object of the right type
in it, since C<assign> doesn't create a new object (as with C<clone>)
or reuse the source object (as with C<set>).

=head3 Properties

Z<CHP-9-SECT-3.3>

X<PMCs (Polymorphic Containers);properties>
PMCs can have additional values attached to them as "properties" of
the PMC. What these properties do is entirely up to the language being
implemented. Most usually properties are used to hold extra metadata about
the PMC that is used by the high-level language (HLL).

The C<setprop>X<setprop opcode (PIR)> opcode sets the value of a
named property on a PMC. It takes three arguments: the PMC to be set
with a property, the name of the property, and a PMC containing the
value of the property. The C<getprop>X<getprop opcode (PIR)> opcode
returns the value of a property. It also takes three arguments: the
PMC to store the property's value, the name of the property, and the
PMC from which the property value is to be retrieved. Internally a PMCs
properties are stored in a Hash structure, where the name of the property
is stored in a special properties Hash.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  new $P0, "String"
  set $P0, "Zaphod"
  new $P1, "Int"
  set $P1, 1
  setprop $P0, "constant", $P1       # set a property on $P0
  getprop $P3, "constant", $P0       # retrieve a property on $P0
  print $P3                          # prints 1
  print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This example creates a C<String> object in C<P0>, and a C<Int>
object with the value 1 in C<P1>. C<setprop> sets a property named
"constant" on the object in C<P0> and gives the property the value in
C<P1>.N<The "constant" property is ignored by PIR, but may be significant
to the HLL that set it.> C<getprop> retrieves the value of the property
"constant" on C<P0> and stores it in C<P3>.

Properties are kept in a separate hash for each PMC. Property values
are always PMCs, but only references to the actual PMCs. Trying to
fetch the value of a property that doesn't exist returns a
C<Undef>.

C<delprop>X<delprop opcode (PIR)> deletes a property from a PMC.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  delprop $P1, "constant"  # delete property

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

You can also return a complete hash of all properties on a PMC with
C<prophash>X<prophash opcode (PIR)>.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  prophash $P0, $P1         # set $P0 to the property hash of $P1

=end PIR_FRAGMENT


=head2 VTABLE Interfaces

Internally, all operations on PMCs are performed by calling various VTABLE
interfaces.

=head3 Type Conversion

The C<=> operator is very powerful.  Its simplest form stores a value into one
of the Parrot registers. It can assign a string value to a C<string> register,
an integer value to an C<int> register, a floating point value into a C<number>
register, etc. However, the C<=> operator can assign I<any> type of value into
I<any> type of register; Parrot will handle the conversion for you
automatically:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $I0 = 5     # Integer. 5
  $S0 = $I0   # Stringify. "5"
  $N0 = $S0   # Numify. 5.0
  $I0 = $N0   # Intify. 5

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Notice that conversions between the numeric formats and strings only makes
sense when the value to convert is a number.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $S0 = "parrot"
  $I0 = $S0        # 0

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

An earlier example showed a string literal assigned to a PMC register of type
C<String>. This works for all the primitive types and their autoboxed PMC
equivalents:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $P0 = new 'Integer'
  $P0 = 5
  $S0 = $P0      # Stringify. "5"
  $N0 = $P0      # Numify. 5.0
  $I0 = $P0      # Unbox. $I0 = 5

  $P1 = new 'String'
  $P1 = "5 birds"
  $S1 = $P1      # Unbox. $S1 = "5 birds"
  $I1 = $P1      # Intify. 5
  $N1 = $P1      # Numify. 5.0

  $P2 = new 'Number'
  $P2 = 3.14
  $S2 = $P2      # Stringify. "3.14"
  $I2 = $P2      # Intify. 3
  $N2 = $P2      # Unbox. $N2 = 3.14

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

=head2 Control Structures

Z<CHP-3-SECT-5>

X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);control flow>
X<control flow;in PIR>

Control flow in PIR occurs entirely with conditional and unconditional branches
to labels. This may seem simplistic and primitive, but here PIR shows its roots
as a thin overlay on the assembly language of a virtual processor.  PIR does
not support high-level looping structures such as C<while> or C<for> loops. PIR
has some support for basic C<if> branching constructs, but does not support
more complicated C<if>/C<then>/C<else> branch structures.  

The control structures of high-level languages hew tightly to the semantics of
those languages; Parrot provides the minimal feature set necessary to implement
any semantic of an HLL without dictating how that HLL may implement its
features.  Language agnosticism is an important design goal in Parrot, and
creates a very flexible and powerful development environment for language
developers.

X<goto instruction (PIR)>
The most basic branching instruction is the unconditional branch, C<goto>:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main'
      goto L1
      print "never printed"

  L1:
      print "after branch"
  .end

=end PIR

The first C<print> statement never runs because the C<goto> always skips over it
to the label C<L1>.

The conditional branches combine C<if> or C<unless> with C<goto>.

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main'
      $I0 = 42
      if $I0 goto L1
      say "never printed"
  L1:
      say "after branch"
  .end

=end PIR

X<if (conditional);instruction (PIR)> X<unless (conditional);instruction (PIR)>
In this example, the C<goto> branches to the label C<L1> only if the value
stored in C<$I0> is true. The C<unless> statement is similar, but it branches
when the tested value is false.  You can use PMC and STRING registers with
C<if> and C<unless>.  The op will call the C<get_bool> vtable entry on any PMC
so used and will convert the STRING to a boolean value.  An undefined value, 0,
or an empty string are all false values. All other values are true.

The comparison operators (C<E<lt>>, C<E<lt>=>, C<==>, C<!=>, C<E<gt>>,
C<E<gt>=>) can combine with C<if ...  goto>. These branch when the
comparison is true:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main'
      $I0 = 42
      $I1 = 43
      if $I0 < $I1 goto L1
      say "never printed"
  L1:
      say "after branch"
  .end

=end PIR

This example compares C<$I0> to C<$I1> and branches to the label C<L1> if
C<$I0> is less than C<$I1>. The C<if $I0 E<lt> $I1 goto L1> statement
translates directly to the C<lt> branch operation.

Chapter 11's "PIR Instructions" section summarizes the other comparison
operators.

X<loops;PIR>
X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);loop constructs>
PIR has no special loop constructs. A combination of conditional and
unconditional branches handle iteration:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main'
      $I0 = 1               # product
      $I1 = 5               # counter

  REDO:                     # start of loop
      $I0 = $I0 * $I1
      dec $I1
      if $I1 > 0 goto REDO  # end of loop

      say $I0
  .end

=end PIR

X<do-while style loop;(PIR)>
This example calculates the factorial C<5!>. Each time through the loop it
multiplies C<$I0> by the current value of the counter C<$I1>, decrements the
counter, and branches to the start of the loop.  The loop ends when C<$I1>
counts down to 0. This is a I<do while>-style loop with the condition test at
the end, so the code always runs the first time through.

X<while-style loop (PIR)>
For a I<while>-style loop with the condition test at the start, use a
conditional branch with an unconditional branch:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main'
      $I0 = 1               # product
      $I1 = 5               # counter

  REDO:                     # start of loop
      if $I1 <= 0 goto LAST
      $I0 = $I0 * $I1
      dec $I1
      goto REDO
  LAST:                     # end of loop

      say $I0
  .end

=end PIR

This example tests the counter C<$I1> at the start of the loop. At the
end of the loop, it unconditionally branches back to the start of the
loop and tests the condition again. The loop ends when the counter
C<$I1> reaches 0 and the C<if> branches to the C<LAST> label. If the
counter isn't a positive number before the loop, the loop never
executes.

You can build any high-level flow control construct from conditional and
unconditional branches; the lowest level of computer hardware works this way.
All modern programming languages use branching constructs to implement their
most complex flow control devices.


Branch instructions transfer control to a relative offset from the
current instruction. The rightmost argument to every branch opcode is
a label, which the assembler converts to the integer value of the
offset. You can also branch on a literal integer value, but there's
rarely any need to do so. The simplest branch instruction is
C<branch>:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    branch L1                # branch 4
    print "skipped\n"
  L1:
    print "after branch\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This example unconditionally branches to the location of the label
C<L1>, skipping over the first C<print> statement.

Jump instructions transfer control to an absolute address. The C<jump>
opcode doesn't calculate an address from a label, so it's used
together with C<set_addr>:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    set_addr $I0, L1
    jump $I0
    print "skipped\n"
    end
  L1:
    print "after jump\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The C<set_addr>X<set_addr opcode (PIR)> opcode takes a label or an
integer offset and returns an absolute address.

You've probably noticed the C<end>X<end opcode (PIR)> opcode as the
last statement in many examples above. This terminates the execution
of the current run loop. Terminating the main bytecode segment (the
first run loop) stops the interpreter. Without the C<end> statement,
execution just falls off the end of the bytecode segment, with a good
chance of crashing the interpreter.

=head3 Conditional Branches

Z<CHP-9-SECT-4.1>

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);conditional branches>
X<conditional branches in PIR>
Unconditional jumps and branches aren't really enough for flow
control. What you need to implement the control structures of
high-level languages is the ability to select different actions based
on a set of conditions. PIR has opcodes that conditionally branch
based on the truth of a single value or the comparison of two values.
The following example has C<if>X<if (conditional);opcode (PIR)> and
C<unless>X<unless (conditional);opcode (PIR)> conditional branches:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    set $I0, 0
    if $I0, TRUE
    unless $I0, FALSE
    print "skipped\n"
    end
  TRUE:
    print "shouldn't happen\n"
    end
  FALSE:
    print "the value was false\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

C<if> branches if its first argument is a true value, and C<unless>
branches if its first argument is a false value. In this case, the
C<if> doesn't branch because C<I0> is false, but the C<unless> does
branch.
The comparison branching opcodes compare two values and branch if the
stated relation holds true. These are
C<eq>X<eq (equal);opcode (PIR)> (branch when equal),
C<ne>X<ne (not equal);opcode (PIR)> (when not equal),
C<lt>X<lt (less than);opcode (PIR)> (when less than),
C<gt>X<gt (greater than);opcode (PIR)> (when greater than),
C<le>X<le (less than or equal);opcode (PIR)> (when less than or
equal), and C<ge>X<ge (greater than or equal);opcode (PIR)> (when
greater than or equal). The two compared arguments must be the same
register type:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    set $I0, 4
    set $I1, 4
    eq $I0, $I1, EQUAL
    print "skipped\n"
    end
  EQUAL:
    print "the two values are equal\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This compares two integers, C<I0> and C<I1>, and branches if they're
equal. Strings of different character sets or encodings are converted
to Unicode before they're compared. PMCs have a C<cmp> vtable method.
This gets called on the left argument to perform the comparison of the
two objects.

The comparison opcodes don't specify if a numeric or string comparison
is intended. The type of the register selects for integers, floats,
and strings. With PMCs, the vtable method C<cmp> or C<is_equal> of the
first argument is responsible for comparing the PMC meaningfully with
the other operand. If you need to force a numeric or string comparison
on two PMCs, use the alternate comparison opcodes that end in the
C<_num> and C<_str> suffixes.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  eq_str $P0, $P1, label     # always a string compare
  gt_num $P0, $P1, label     # always numerically

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Finally, the C<eq_addr> opcode branches if two PMCs or strings are
actually the same object (have the same address):

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  eq_addr $P0, $P1, same_pmcs_found

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

=head3 Iteration

Z<CHP-9-SECT-4.2>

X<iteration;in PIR>
X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);iteration>
PIR doesn't define high-level loop constructs. These are built up
from a combination of conditional and unconditional branches. A
I<do-while>X<do-while style loop;(PIR)> style loop can be constructed
with a single conditional branch:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    set $I0, 0
    set $I1, 10
  REDO:
    inc $I0
    print $I0
    print "\n"
    lt $I0, $I1, REDO

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This example prints out the numbers 1 to 10. The first time through,
it executes all statements up to the C<lt> statement.  If the
condition evaluates as true (C<I0> is less than C<I1>) it branches to
the C<REDO> label and runs the three statements in the loop body
again. The loop ends when the condition evaluates as false.

Conditional and unconditional branches can build up quite complex
looping constructs, as follows:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    # loop ($i=1; $i<=10; $i++) {
    #    print "$i\n";
    # }
  loop_init:
    set $I0, 1
    branch loop_test
  loop_body:
    print $I0
    print "\n"
    branch loop_continue
  loop_test:
    le $I0, 10, loop_body
    branch out
  loop_continue:
    inc $I0
    branch loop_test
  out:
    # ... 

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

X<loops;PIR>
X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);loops>
This example emulates a X<counter-controlled loop> counter-controlled
loop like Perl 6's C<loop> keyword or C's C<for>. The first time
through the loop it sets the initial value of the counter in
C<loop_init>, tests that the loop condition is met in C<loop_test>,
and then executes the body of the loop in C<loop_body>. If the test
fails on the first iteration, the loop body will never execute. The
end of C<loop_body> branches to C<loop_continue>, which increments the
counter and then goes to C<loop_test> again. The loop ends when the
condition fails, and it branches to C<out>. The example is more
complex than it needs to be just to count to 10, but it nicely shows
the major components of a
loop.

=head2 Subroutines

X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);subroutine> X<subroutine (PIR)>
Subroutines in PIR are roughly equivalent to the subroutines or methods of a
high-level language.  All code in a PIR source file must occur within a
subroutine.  The simplest syntax for a PIR subroutine starts with the C<.sub>
directive and ends with the C<.end> directiveN<The name C<main> is only a
convention.>:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main'
      say "Hello, Polly."
  .end

=end PIR

This example defines a subroutine named C<main> that prints a string C<"Hello,
Polly.">. Parrot will normally execute the first subroutine it encounters in
the first file it runs, but you can flag any subroutine as the first one to
execute with the C<:main> marker:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'first'
      say "Polly want a cracker?"
  .end

  .sub 'second' :main
      say "Hello, Polly."
  .end

=end PIR

This code prints out "Hello, Polly." but not "Polly want a cracker?".  Though
the C<first> function appears first in the source code, C<second> has the
C<:main> flag and gets called.  C<first> is never called.  Revising that
program produces different results:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'first' :main
      say "Polly want a cracker?"
  .end

  .sub 'second'
      say "Hello, Polly."
  .end

=end PIR

The output now is "Polly want a cracker?". Execution in PIR starts at the
C<:main> function and continues until that function ends.  To perform other
operations, you must call other functions explicitly.  Chapter 4 describes
subroutines and their uses.


X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);subroutines>
X<subroutines;in PIR>
The most basic building block of code reuse in PIR is the subroutine. A large
program may perform a calculation like "the factorial of a number" several
times.  Subroutines abstract this behavior into a single, named, stand-alone
unit. PIR is a subroutine-based language in that all code in PIR must exist in
a subroutine. Execution starts in the C<:main> subroutine, which itself can
call other subroutines.  Subroutines can fit together into more elaborate
chunks of code reusability such as methods and objects.

Parrot supports multiple high-level languages.  Each language uses a different
syntax for defining and calling subroutines. The goal of PIR is not to be a
high-level language in itself, but to provide the basic tools that other
languages can use to implement them. PIR's subroutine syntax may seem very
primitive for this reason.

=head3 Parrot Calling Conventions

Z<CHP-4-SECT-1>

X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);subroutines;Parrot calling conventions>
X<subroutines;Parrot calling conventions;in PIR>

The C<.sub> directive defines globally accessible subroutine
objects.

Subroutine objects of all kinds can be called with the
C<invoke>X<invoke opcode (PIR)> opcode. There is also an C<invoke>
C<PR<x>> instruction for calling objects held in a different register.

The C<invokecc>X<invokecc opcode (PIR)> opcode is like C<invoke>, but it
also creates and stores a new return continuation. When the
called subroutine invokes this return continuation, it returns control
to the instruction after the function call. This kind of call is known
as Continuation Passing Style (CPS).
X<CPS (Continuation Passing Style)>
X<Continuation Passing Style (CPS)>

The way that Parrot calls a subroutine -- passing arguments, altering control
flow, and returning results -- is the "Parrot Calling Conventions" (PCC).
Parrot generally hides the details of PCC from the programmer.  PIR has several
constructs to gloss over these details, and the average programmer will not
need to worry about them.  PCC uses the Continuation Passing Style
X<Continuation Passing Style (CPS)>X<CPS (Continuation Passing Style)> (CPS) to
pass control to subroutines and back again. Again, the details are irrelevant
for most uses, but the power is available to anyone who wants to take advantage
of it.

=head3 Subroutine Calls

X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);subroutine calls>
PIR's simplest subroutine call syntax looks much like a subroutine
call from a high-level language. This example calls the subroutine
C<fact> with two arguments and assigns the result to C<$I0>:

  $I0 = 'fact'(count, product)

This simple statement hides much complexity. It generates a subroutine PMC
object, creates a continuation PMC object to represent the control flow up to
this point, passes the arguments, looks up the subroutine by name (and by
signature, if necessary)), calls the subroutine, and assigns the results of the
call to the appropriate integer register. This is all in addition to the
computation the subroutine itself performs.

The single line subroutine call is incredibly convenient, but it isn't always
flexible enough. PIR also has a more verbose call syntax that is still more
convenient than manual calls. This example looks up the subroutine C<fact> out
in the global symbol table and calls it:

  find_global $P1, "fact"

  .begin_call
    .arg count
    .arg product
    .call $P1
    .result $I0
  .end_call

X<.arg directive>
X<.result directive>
The whole chunk of code from C<.begin_call> to C<.end_call> acts as a single
unit. The C<.arg> directive sets up and passes arguments to the call. The
C<.call> directive calls the subroutine and identifies the point at which to
return control flow after the subroutine has completed. The C<.result>
directive retrieves returned values from the call.

=head3 Subroutine Declarations

X<.param directive> In addition to syntax for subroutine calls, PIR provides
syntax for subroutine definitions: the C<.sub> and C<.end> directives shown in
earlier examples.  The C<.param> directive defines input parameters and creates
local named variables for them (similar to C<.local>):

  .param int c

X<.return directive>
The C<.return> directive allows the subroutine to return control flow
to the calling subroutine, and optionally returns result output values.

Here's a complete code example that implements the factorial algorithm.  The
subroutine C<fact> is a separate subroutine, assembled and processed after the
C<main> function.  Parrot resolves global symbols like the C<fact> label
between different units.

=begin PIR

  # factorial.pir
  .sub 'main' :main
     .local int count
     .local int product
     count   = 5
     product = 1

     $I0 = 'fact'(count, product)

     say $I0
  .end

  .sub 'fact'
     .param int c
     .param int p

  loop:
     if c <= 1 goto fin
     p = c * p
     dec c
     branch loop
  fin:
     .return (p)
  .end

=end PIR

This example defines two local named variables, C<count> and C<product>, and
assigns them the values 1 and 5. It calls the C<fact> subroutine with both
variables as arguments.  The C<fact> subroutine uses C<.param> to retrieve
these parameters and C<.return> to return the result.  The final printed result
is 120.

As usual, execution of the program starts at the C<:main> subroutine.

call.  Putting positional arguments in a different order will produce different
effects, or may cause errors. Parrot also supports I<named parameters>. Instead
of passing parameters by their position in the string, parameters are passed by
name and can be in any order.  Here's an example:

=begin PIR

 .sub 'MySub'
    .param string yrs :named("age")
    .param string call :named("name")
    $S0 = "Hello " . call
    $S1 = "You are " . yrs
    $S1 = $S1 . " years old"
    say $S0
    say $S1
 .end

 .sub 'main' :main
    'MySub'("age" => 42, "name" => "Bob")
 .end

=end PIR

You can also pass these pairs in the opposite order:

=begin PIR

 .sub 'main' :main
    'MySub'("name" => "Bob", "age" => 42)    # Same!
 .end

=end PIR

Named arguments can be a big help because you don't have to worry about the
exact order of variables, especially as argument lists get very long.

=head4 Optional Parameters

X<optional arguments>
Some functions have arguments with appropriate default values, so that callers
don't always have to pass them.  Parrot provides a mechanism to identify
optional argument.  Parrot also provides a flag value to determine if the
caller has passed in an optional argument.

Optional parameters appear in PIR as if they're actually I<two> parameters:
the value and its flag:

  .param string name     :optional
  .param int    has_name :opt_flag

The C<:optional> flag specifies that the given parameter is optional.  The
C<:opt_flag> specifies an integer which parameter contains a boolean flag; this
flag is true if the value was passed, and false otherwise. To provide a default
value for an optional parameter, you can write:

    .param string name     :optional
    .param int    has_name :opt_flag

    if has_name goto we_have_a_name
    name = "Default value"
  we_have_a_name:

Optional parameters can be positional or named parameters. When using them with
positional parameters, they must appear at the end of the list of positional
parameters. Also, the C<:opt_flag> parameter must always appear directly after
the C<:optional> parameter.

  .sub 'Foo'
    .param int optvalue :optional
    .param int hasvalue :opt_flag
    .param pmc notoptional          # WRONG!
    ...

  .sub 'Bar'
     .param int hasvalue :opt_flag
     .param int optvalue :optional  # WRONG!
     ...

  .sub 'Baz'
    .param int optvalue :optional
    .param pmc notoptional
    .param int hasvalue :opt_flag   # WRONG!
    ...

You may mix optional parameters with named parameters:

  .sub 'MySub'
    .param int value     :named("answer") :optional
    .param int has_value :opt_flag
    ...

You can call this function in two ways:

  'MySub'("answer" => 42)  # with a value
  'MySub'()                # without

=head4 Commandline Arguments

Programs written in Parrot have access to arguments passed on the command
line:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'MyMain' :main
    .param pmc all_args :slurpy
    # ...
  .end

=end PIR

=for author

Please verify and expand.

=end for

The C<all_args> PMC is a ResizableStringArray PMC, which means you can loop
over the results, access them individually, or even modify them.

=head3 Continuations

X<continuations>

A continuation is a subroutine that captures a complete copy of the
caller's context. Invoking a
continuation starts or restarts it at the entry point:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    new $P1, "Integer"
    set $P1, 5

    newsub $P0, 'Continuation', _con
  _con:
    print "in cont "
    print $P1
    print "\n"
    dec $P1
    unless $P1, done
    invoke                        # $P0
  done:
    print "done\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

This prints:

  in cont 5
  in cont 4
  in cont 3
  in cont 2
  in cont 1
  done

Continuations are a kind of subroutine that take a snapshots of control
flow. They are frozen images of the current
execution state of the VM. Once you have a continuation, you can invoke it to
return to the point where the continuation was first created. It's like a
magical timewarp that allows the developer to arbitrarily move control flow
back to any previous point in the program.

Continuations are like any other PMC; you can create one with the C<new> opcode:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $P0 = new 'Continuation'

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The new continuation starts off in an undefined state. If you attempt to invoke
a new continuation without initializing it, Parrot will throw an exception.  To
prepare the continuation for use, assign it a destination label with the
C<set_addr> opcode:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    $P0 = new 'Continuation'
    set_addr $P0, my_label

  my_label:
    # ...

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

To jump to the continuation's stored label and return the context to the state
it was in I<at the point of its creation>, invoke the continuation:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

  invoke $P0  # Explicit using "invoke" opcode
  $P0()       # Same, but nicer syntax

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

Even though you can use the subroutine notation C<$P0()> to invoke the
continuation, it doesn't make any sense to pass arguments or obtain return
values:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  $P0 = new 'Continuation'
  set_addr $P0, my_label

  $P0(1, 2)      # WRONG!

  $P1 = $P0()    # WRONG!

=end PIR_FRAGMENT


=head4 Continuation Passing Style

X<continuation passing style>
X<CPS>

Parrot uses continuations internally for control flow. When Parrot
invokes a function, it creates a continuation representing the
current point in the program.  It passes this continuation as an invisible
parameter to the function call.  When that function returns, it invokes the
continuation -- in effect, it performs a goto to the point of creation of that
continuation.  If you have a continuation, you can invoke it to return to its
point of creation any time you want.

This type of flow control -- invoking continuations instead of performing bare
jumps -- is X<Continuation Passing Style;CPS> Continuation Passing Style (CPS).



=head4 Tailcalls

In many cases, a subroutine will set up and call another subroutine, and then
return the result of the second call directly. This is a X<tailcall> tailcall,
and is an important opportunity for optimization.  Here's a contrived example
in pseudocode:

  call add_two(5)

  subroutine add_two(value)
    value = add_one(value)
    return add_one(value)

In this example, the subroutine C<add_two> makes two calls to c<add_one>. The
second call to C<add_one> is the return value. C<add_one> gets called; its
result gets returned to the caller of C<add_two>.  Nothing in C<add_two> uses
that return value directly.

A simple optimization is available for this type of code.  The second call to
C<add_one> can return to the same place that C<add_two> returns; therefore,
it's perfectly safe and correct to use the same return continuation that
C<add_two> uses. The two subroutine calls can share a return continuation,
instead of having to create a new continuation for each call.

X<.tailcall directive>

PIR provides the C<.tailcall> directive to identify similar situations.  Use it
in place of the C<.return> directive. C<.tailcall> performs this optimization
by reusing the return continuation of the parent function to make the tailcall:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main' :main
      .local int value
      value = add_two(5)
      say value
  .end

  .sub 'add_two'
      .param int value
      .local int val2
      val2 = add_one(value)
      .tailcall add_one(val2)
  .end

  .sub 'add_one'
      .param int a
      .local int b
      b = a + 1
      .return (b)
  .end

=end PIR

This example above will print out the correct value "7".

=head3 Native Call Interface

Z<CHP-9-SECT-7.2>

X<subroutines;calling conventions;NCI>
A special version of the Parrot calling conventions are used by the
X<NCI (Native Call Interface)> Native Call Interface (NCI) for calling
subroutines with a known prototype in shared libraries. This is not
really portable across all libraries, but it's worth a short example.
This is a simplified version of the first test in F<t/pmc/nci.t>:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    loadlib $P1, "libnci_test"      # get library object for a shared lib
    print "loaded\n"
    dlfunc $P0, $P1, "nci_dd", "dd" # obtain the function object
    print "dlfunced\n"
    set $I0, 1                      # prototype used - unchecked
    set_args "0", 4.0               # set the argument
    get_results "0", $N5            # prepare to store the return value
    invokecc $P0                    # call nci_dd
    ne $N5, 8.0, nok_1              # the test functions returns 2*arg
    print "ok 1\n"
    end
    nok_1:
    #...

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This example shows two new instructions: C<loadlib> and C<dlfunc>. The
C<loadlib>X<loadlib opcode (PIR)> opcode obtains a handle for a shared
library. It searches for the shared library in the current directory,
in F<runtime/parrot/dynext>, and in a few other configured
directories. It also tries to load the provided filename unaltered and
with appended extensions like C<.so> or C<.dll>. Which extensions it
tries depends on the OS Parrot is running on.

The C<dlfunc>X<dlfunc opcode (PIR)> opcode gets a function object from a
previously loaded library (second argument) of a specified name (third
argument) with a known function signature (fourth argument). The
function signature is a string where the first character is the return
value and the rest of the parameters are the function parameters. The
characters used in X<NCI (Native Call Interface);function signatures>
NCI function signatures are listed in Table 9-5.

=head3 Coroutines

X<PIR;Coroutines>
X<Coroutines>

As we mentioned in the previous chapter, coroutines are
X<subroutines;coroutines> subroutines that
can suspend themselves and return control to the caller--and then pick
up where they left off the next time they're called, as if they never
left.

X<coroutines>
In PIR, coroutines are subroutine-like objects:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

  newsub P0, .Coroutine, _co_entry

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

The C<Coroutine> object has its own user stack, register frame stacks,
control stack, and pad stack. The pad stack is inherited from the
caller. The coroutine's control stack has the caller's control stack
prepended, but is still distinct. When the coroutine invokes itself,
it returns to the caller and restores the caller's context (basically
swapping all stacks). The next time the coroutine is invoked, it
continues to execute from the point at which it previously returned:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    new_pad 0                # push a new lexical pad on stack
    new P0, "Int"            # save one variable in it
    set P0, 10
    store_lex -1, "var", P0

    newsub P0, .Coroutine, _cor
                             # make a new coroutine object
    saveall                  # preserve environment
    invoke                   # invoke the coroutine
    restoreall
    print "back\n"
    saveall
    invoke                   # invoke coroutine again
    restoreall
    print "done\n"
    pop_pad
    end

  _cor:
    find_lex P1, "var"       # inherited pad from caller
    print "in cor "
    print P1
    print "\n"
    inc P1                   # var++
    saveall
    invoke                   # yield(  )
    restoreall
    print "again "
    branch _cor              # next invocation of the coroutine

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

This prints out the result:

  in cor 10
  back
  again in cor 11
  done

X<invoke opcode (PIR);coroutines and>
The C<invoke> inside the coroutine is commonly referred to as
I<yield>. The coroutine never ends. When it reaches the bottom, it
branches back up to C<_cor> and executes until it hits C<invoke>
again.

The interesting part about this example is that the coroutine yields
in the same way that a subroutine is called. This means that the
coroutine has to preserve its own register values. This example uses
C<saveall> but it could have only stored the registers the coroutine
actually used. Saving off the registers like this works because
coroutines have their own register frame stacks.

We've mentioned coroutines several times before, and we're finally going
to explain what they are. Coroutines are similar to subroutines except
that they have an internal notion of I<state> N<And the cool new name!>.
Coroutines, in addition to performing a normal C<.return> to return
control flow back to the caller and destroy the lexical environment of
the subroutine, may also perform a C<.yield> operation. C<.yield> returns
a value to the caller like C<.return> can, but it does not destroy the
lexical state of the coroutine. The next time the coroutine is called, it
continues execution from the point of the last C<.yield>, not at the
beginning of the coroutine.

In a Coroutine, when we continue from a C<.yield>, the entire lexical
environment is the same as it was when C<.yield> was called. This
means that the parameter values don't change, even if we call the
coroutine with different arguments later.

Coroutines are defined like any ordinary subroutine. They do not require
any special flag or any special syntax to mark them as being a
coroutine. However, what sets them apart is the use of the C<.yield>
directive. C<.yield> plays several roles:

=over 4

=item * Identifies coroutines

When Parrot sees a yield, it knows to create a Coroutine PMC object
instead of a Sub PMC.

=item * Creates a continuation

Continuations, as we have already seen, allow us to continue
execution at the point of the continuation later. It's like a snapshot of
the current execution environment. C<.yield> creates a continuation in
the coroutine and stores the continuation object in the coroutine object
or later resuming from the point of the C<.yield>.

=item * Returns a value

C<.yield> can return a value N<or many values, or no values> to the caller.
It is basically the same as a C<.return> in this regard.

=back

Here is a quick example of a simple coroutine:

  .sub 'MyCoro'
    .yield(1)
    .yield(2)
    .yield(3)
    .return(4)
  .end

  .sub 'main' :main
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 1
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 2
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 3
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 4
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 1
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 2
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 3
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 4
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 1
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 2
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 3
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 4
  .end

This is obviously a contrived example, but it demonstrates how the coroutine
stores it's state. The coroutine stores it's state when we reach a C<.yield>
directive, and when the coroutine is called again it picks up where it last
left off. Coroutines also handle parameters in a way that might not be
intuitive. Here's an example of this:

  .sub 'StoredConstant'
    .param int x
    .yield(x)
    .yield(x)
    .yield(x)
  .end

  .sub 'main' :main
    $I0 = StoredConstant(5)       # $I0 = 5
    $I0 = StoredConstant(6)       # $I0 = 5
    $I0 = StoredConstant(7)       # $I0 = 5
    $I0 = StoredConstant(8)       # $I0 = 8
  .end

Notice how even though we are calling the C<StoredConstant> coroutine with
different arguments each time, the value of parameter C<x> doesn't change
until the coroutine's state resets after the last C<.yield>. Remember that
a continuation takes a snapshot of the current state, and the C<.yield>
directive takes a continuation. The next time we call the coroutine, it
invokes the continuation internally, and returns us to the exact same place in
the exact same condition as we were when we called the C<.yield>. In order
to reset the coroutine and enable it to take a new parameter, we must either
execute a C<.return> directive or reach the end of the coroutine.

=head3 Multiple Dispatch

Multiple dispatch is when there are multiple subroutines in a single
namespace with the same name. These functions must differ, however, in
their parameter list, or "signature". All subs with the same name get
put into a single PMC called a MultiSub. The MultiSub is like a list
of subroutines. When the multisub is invoked, the MultiSub PMC object
searches through the list of subroutines and searches for the one with
the closest matching signature. The best match is the sub that gets
invoked.

MultiSubs are subroutines with the C<:multi> flag applied to them.
MultiSubs (also called "Multis") must all differ from one another in
the number and/or type of arguments passed to the function. Having
two multisubs with the same function signature could result in a
parsing error, or the later function could overwrite the former one
in the multi.

Multisubs are defined like this:

  .sub 'MyMulti' :multi
      # does whatever a MyMulti does
  .end

Multis belong to a specific namespace. Functions in different namespaces
with the same name do not conflict with each other N<this is one of the
reasons for having multisubs in the first place!>. It's only when
multiple functions in a single namespace need to have the same name that
a multi is used.

Multisubs take a special designator called a I<multi signature>. The multi
signature tells Parrot what particular combination of input parameters the
multi accepts. Each multi will have a different signature, and Parrot will
be able to dispatch to each one depending on the arguments passed. The
multi signature is specified in the C<:multi> directive:

  .sub 'Add' :multi(I, I)
    .param int x
    .param int y
    .return(x + y)
  .end

  .sub 'Add' :multi(N, N)
    .param num x
    .param num y
    .return(x + y)
  .end

  .sub 'Start' :main
    $I0 = Add(1, 2)      # 3
    $N0 = Add(3.14, 2.0) # 5.14
    $S0 = Add("a", "b")  # ERROR! No (S, S) variant!
  .end

Multis can take I, N, S, and P types, but they can also use C<_> (underscore)
to denote a wildcard, and a string that can be the name of a particular PMC
type:

  .sub 'Add' :multi(I, I)  # Two integers
    ...

  .sub 'Add' :multi(I, 'Float')  # An integer and Float PMC
    ...

                           # Two Integer PMCs
  .sub 'Add' :multi('Integer', _)
    ...

When we call a multi PMC, Parrot will try to take the most specific
best-match variant, and will fall back to more general variants if a perfect
best-match cannot be found. So if we call C<'Add'(1, 2)>, Parrot will dispatch
to the C<(I, I)> variant. If we call C<'Add'(1, "hi")>, Parrot will match the
C<(I, _)> variant, since the string in the second argument doesn't match C<I>
or C<'Float'>. Parrot can also choose to automatically promote one of the I,
N, or S values to an Integer, Float, or String PMC.

To make the decision about which multi variant to call, Parrot takes a
I<Manhattan Distance> between the two. Parrot calculates the I<distance>
between the multi signatures and the argument signature. Every difference
counts as one step. A difference can be an autobox from a primitive type
to a PMC, or the conversion from one primitive type to another, or the
matching of an argument to a C<_> wildcard. After Parrot calculates the
distance to each variant, it calls the function with the lowest distance.
Notice that it's possible to define a variant that is impossible to call:
for every potential combination of arguments there is a better match. This
isn't necessarily a common occurrence, but it's something to watch out for
in systems with a lot of multis and a limited number of data types in use.

=head3 Sub PMCs

Subroutines are a PMC type in Parrot. You can store them in PMC registers and
manipulate them just as you do the other PMC types.  Look up a subroutine in
the current namespace with the C<get_global> opcode:

  $P0 = get_global "MySubName"

To find a subroutine in a different namespace, first look up the appropriate
the namespace PMC, then use that with C<get_global>:

  $P0 = get_namespace "MyNamespace"
  $P1 = get_global $P0, "MySubName"

You can obviously invoke a Sub PMC:

  $P0(1, 2, 3)

You can get or even I<change> its name:

  $S0 = $P0               # Get the current name
  $P0 = "MyNewSubName"    # Set a new name

You can get a hash of the complete metadata for the subroutine:

  $P1 = inspect $P0

The metadata fields in this hash are

=over 4

=item * pos_required

The number of required positional parameters to the Sub

=item * pos_optional

The number of optional positional parameters to the Sub

=item * named_required

The number of required named parameters to the Sub

=item * named_optional

The number of optional named parameters to the Sub

=item * pos_slurpy

Returns true if the sub has a slurpy parameter to eat up extra positional args

=item * named_slurpy

Returns true if the sub has a slurpy parameter to eat up extra named args

=back

Instead of getting the whole inspection hash, you ask about individual pieces
of metadata:

  $I0 = inspect $P0, "pos_required"

To discover to get the total number of defined parameters to the Sub, call the
C<arity> method:

  $I0 = $P0.'arity'()

To fetch the namespace PMC that the Sub was defined into, call the
C<get_namespace> method:

  $P1 = $P0.'get_namespace'()

=head3 Evaluating a Code String

Z<CHP-9-SECT-7.6>

X<code strings, evaluating>
This isn't really a subroutine operation, but it does produce a code
object that can be invoked. In this case, it's a X<bytecode segment
object> bytecode segment object.

The first step is to get an assembler or compiler for the target
language:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  compreg $P1, "PIR"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Within the Parrot interpreter there are currently three registered
languages: C<PASM>, C<PIR>, and C<PASM1>. The first two are for parrot
assembly language and parrot intermediate representation code. The third
is for evaluating single statements in PASM. Parrot automatically adds
an C<end> opcode at the end of C<PASM1> strings before they're
compiled.

This example places a bytecode segment object into the destination
register C<P0> and then invokes it with C<invoke>:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

  compreg P1, "PASM1"                # get compiler
  set S1, "in eval\n"
  compile P0, P1, "print S1"
  invoke                             # eval code P0
  print "back again\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

You can register a compiler or assembler for any language inside the
Parrot core and use it to compile and invoke code from that language.
These compilers may be written in PIR or reside in shared libraries.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  compreg "MyLanguage", $P10

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

In this example the C<compreg> opcode registers the subroutine-like
object C<P10> as a compiler for the language "MyLanguage". See
F<examples/compilers> and F<examples/japh/japh16.pasm> for an external
compiler in a shared library.



=head2 Lexicals and Globals

So far, we've been treating Parrot registers like the variables of a
high-level language. This is fine, as far as it goes, but it isn't the
full picture. The dynamic nature and introspective features of
languages like Perl make it desirable to manipulate variables by name,
instead of just by register or stack location. These languages also
have global variables, which are visible throughout the entire
program. Storing a global variable in a register would either tie up
that register for the lifetime of the program or require some unwieldy way
to shuffle the data into and out of registers.

Parrot provides structures for storing both global and lexically
scoped named variables. Lexical and global variables must be PMC
values. PIR provides instructions for storing and retrieving
variables from these structures so the PIR opcodes can operate on
their values.

=head3 Globals

Z<CHP-9-SECT-6.1>

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);global variables>
Global variables are stored in a C<Hash>, so every variable name
must be unique.  PIR has two opcodes for globals, C<set_global> and
C<get_global>:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

  new P10, "Int"
  set P10, 42
  set_global "$foo", P10
  # ...
  get_global P0, "$foo"
  print P0                        # prints 42

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

The first two statements create a C<Int> in the PMC register
C<P10> and give it the value 42. In the third statement,
C<set_global> stores that PMC as the named global variable C<$foo>.
At some later point in the program, C<get_global> retrieves the PMC
from the global variable by name, and stores it in C<P0> so it can be
printed.

The C<set_global> opcode only stores a reference to the object. If
we add an increment statement:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  inc $P10

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

after the C<set_global> it increments the stored global, printing 43.
If that's not what you want, you can C<clone> the PMC before you store
it. Leaving the global variable as an alias does have advantages,
though. If you retrieve a stored global into a register and modify it
as follows:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

  get_global P0, "varname"
  inc P0

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

the value of the stored global is directly modified, so you don't need
to call C<set_global> again.

The two-argument forms of C<set_global> and C<get_global> store or
retrieve globals from the outermost namespace (what Perl users will
know as the "main" namespace). A simple flat global namespace isn't
enough for most languages, so Parrot also needs to support
hierarchical namespaces for separating packages (classes and modules
in Perl 6). Use C<set_rootglobal> and
C<get_root_global> add an argument to select a nested namespace:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

  set_root_global ["Foo"], "var", P0 # store P0 as var in the Foo namespace
  get_root_global P1, ["Foo"], "var"  # get Foo::var

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

Eventually the global opcodes will have variants that take a PMC to
specify the namespace, but the design and implementation of these
aren't finished yet.

=head3 Lexicals

X<PIR (Parrot assembly language);lexical variables>
Lexical variables are stored in a lexical scratchpad. There's one pad
for each lexical scope. Every pad has both a hash and an array, so
elements can be stored either by name or by numeric index.

=head4 Basic instructions

Z<CHP-9-SECT-6.2.1>

To store a lexical variable in the current scope pad, use C<store_lex>.
Likewise, use C<find_lex> to retrieve a variable from the current pad.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  new $P0, "Int"            # create a variable
  set $P0, 10               # assign value to it
  store_lex "foo", $P0      # store the var with the variable name "foo"
  # ...
  find_lex $P1, "foo"       # get the var "foo" into P1
  print $P1
  print "\n"                # prints 10

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

As we have seen above, we can declare a new subroutine to be a nested inner
subroutine of an existing outer subroutine using the C<:outer> flag. The
outer flag is used to specify the name of the outer subroutine. Where there
may be multiple subroutines with the same name N<such is the case with
multisubs, which we will discuss soon>, we can use the C<:subid> flag on the
outer subroutine to give it a different--and unique--name that the lexical
subroutines can reference in their C<:outer> declarations. Within lexical
subroutines, the C<.lex> command defines a local variable that follows these
scoping rules.

=head3 LexPad and LexInfo PMCs

Information about lexical variables in a subroutine is stored in two different
types of PMCs: The LexPad PMC that we already mentioned briefly, and the
LexInfo PMCs which we haven't. Neither of these PMC types are really usable
from PIR code, but are instead used by Parrot internally to store information
about lexical variables.

C<LexInfo> PMCs are used to store information about lexical variables at
compile time. This is read-only information that is generated during
compilation to represent what is known about lexical variables. Not all
subroutines get a LexInfo PMC by default, you need to indicate to Parrot
somehow that you require a LexInfo PMC to be created. One way to do this is
with the C<.lex> directive that we looked at above. Of course, the C<.lex>
directive only works for languages where the names of lexical variables are
all known at compile time. For languages where this information isn't known,
the subroutine can be flagged with C<:lex> instead.

C<LexPad> PMCs are used to store run-time information about lexical variables.
This includes their current values and their type information. LexPad PMCs are
created at runtime for subs that have a C<LexInfo> PMC already. These are
created each time the subroutine is invoked, which allows for recursive
subroutine calls without overwriting variable names.

With a Subroutine PMC, you can get access to the associated LexInfo PMC by
calling the C<'get_lexinfo'> method:

  $P0 = find_global "MySubroutine"
  $P1 = $P0.'get_lexinfo'()

Once you have the LexInfo PMC, there are a limited number of operations that
you can call with it:

  $I0 = elements $P1    # Get the number of lexical variables from it
  $P0 = $P1["name"]     # Get the entry for lexical variable "name"

There really isn't much else useful to do with LexInfo PMCs, they're mostly
used by Parrot internally and aren't helpful to the PIR programmer.

There is no easy way to get a reference to the current LexPad PMC in a given
subroutine, but like LexInfo PMCs that doesn't matter because they aren't
useful from PIR anyway. Remember that subroutines themselves can be lexical
and that therefore the lexical environment of a given variable can extend to
multiple subroutines and therefore multiple LexPads. The opcodes C<find_lex>
and C<store_lex> automatically search through nested LexPads recursively to
find the proper environment information about the given variables.

=head3 Lexical Subroutines

X<Lexical Subroutines>

Parrot offers support for lexical subroutines.  You can define a subroutine by
name inside a larger subroutine, where the inner subroutine is only visible and
callable from the outer. The inner subroutine inherits all the lexical
variables from the outer subroutine, but can itself define its own lexical
variables that the outer subroutine cannot access.   PIR lacks the concept of
blocks or nested lexical scopes; this is how it performs the same function.

If the subroutine is lexical, you can get its C<:outer> with the C<get_outer>
method on the Sub PMC:

  $P1 = $P0.'get_outer'()

If there is no C<:outer> PMC, this returns a NULL PMC. Conversely, you can
set the outer sub:

  $P0.'set_outer'($P1)

=head3 Scope and HLLs

As mentioned previously, X<High Level Languages;HLL> High Level Languages such
as Perl, Python, and Ruby allow nested scopes, or blocks within blocks that can
have their own lexical variables.  Even this construct is common in the C
programming language:

  {
      int x = 0;
      int y = 1;
      {
          int z = 2;
          /* x, y, and z are all visible here */
      }

      /* only x and y are visible here */
  }

In the inner block, all three varaibles are visible.  The variable C<z> is only
visible inside that block. The outer block has no knowledge of C<z>.  A very
direct, naI<iuml>ve translation of this code to PIR might be:

  .param int x
  .param int y
  .param int z
  x = 0
  y = 1
  z = 2
  ...

This PIR code is similar, but the handling of the variable C<z> is different:
C<z> is visible throughout the entire current subroutine, where it is not
visible throughout the entire C function. To help approximate this effect, PIR
supplies lexical subroutines to create nested lexical scopes.

=head3 PIR Scoping

Only one PIR structure supports scoping like this: the subroutineN<... and
objects that inherit from subroutines, such as methods, coroutines, and
multisubs>. There are no blocks in PIR that have their own scope besides
subroutines. Fortunately, we can use these lexical subroutines to simulate this
behavior that HLLs require:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'MyOuter'
      .local int x,y
      .lex 'x', x
      .lex 'y', y
      'MyInner'()
      # only x and y are visible here
  .end

  .sub 'MyInner' :outer('MyOuter')
      .local int z
      .lex 'z', z
      #x, y, and z are all "visible" here
  .end

=end PIR

In the example above we put the word C<"visible"> in quotes. This is because
lexically-defined variables need to be accessed with the C<get_lex> and
C<set_lex> opcodes. These two opcodes don't just access the value of a
register, where the value is stored while it's being used, but they also make
sure to interact with the C<LexPad> PMC that's storing the data. If the value
isn't properly stored in the LexPad, then they won't be available in nested
inner subroutines, or available from C<:outer> subroutines either.

=head2 Namespaces

X<Namespaces>
X<.namespace>
Namespaces provide a mechanism where names can be reused. This may not
sound like much, but in large complicated systems, or systems with
many included libraries, it can be very handy. Each namespace gets its
own area for function names and global variables. This way you can have
multiple functions named C<create> or C<new> or C<convert>, for
instance, without having to use I<Multi-Method Dispatch> (MMD) which we
will describe later. Namespaces are also vital for defining classes and their
methods, which we already mentioned. We'll talk about all those uses here.

Namespaces are specified with the C<.namespace []> directive. The brackets
are not optional, but the keys inside them are. Here are some examples:

  .namespace [ ]               # The root namespace
  .namespace [ "Foo" ]         # The namespace "Foo"
  .namespace [ "Foo" ; "Bar" ] # Namespace Foo::Bar
  .namespace                   # WRONG! The [] are needed

Using semicolons, namespaces can be nested to any arbitrary depth.
Namespaces are special types of PMC, so we can access them and manipulate
them just like other data objects. We can get the PMC for the root
namespace using the C<get_root_namespace> opcode:

  $P0 = get_root_namespace

The current namespace, which might be different from the root namespace
can be retrieved with the C<get_namespace> opcode:

  $P0 = get_namespace             # get current namespace PMC
  $P0 = get_namespace ["Foo"]     # get PMC for namespace "Foo"

Namespaces are arranged into a large n-ary tree. There is the root namespace
at the top of the tree, and in the root namespace are various special HLL
namespaces. Each HLL compiler gets its own HLL namespace where it can store
its data during compilation and runtime. Each HLL namespace may have a large
hierarchy of other namespaces. We'll talk more about HLL namespaces and their
significance in chapter 10.

The root namespace is a busy place. Everybody could be lazy and use it to store
all their subroutines and global variables, and then we would run into all
sorts of collisions. One library would define a function "Foo", and then
another library could try to create another subroutine with the same name.
This is called I<namespace pollution>, because everybody is trying to put
things into the root namespace, and those things are all unrelated to each
other. Best practices requires that namespaces be used to hold private
information away from public information, and to keep like things together.

As an example, the namespace C<Integers> could be used to store subroutines
that deal with integers. The namespace C<images> could be used to store
subroutines that deal with creating and manipulating images. That way, when
we have a subroutine that adds two numbers together, and a subroutine that
performs additive image composition, we can name them both C<add> without any
conflict or confusion. And within the C<image> namespace we could have sub
namespaces for C<jpeg> and C<MRI> and C<schematics>, and each of these could
have a C<add> method without getting into each other's way.

The short version is this: use namespaces. There aren't any penalties to them,
and they do a lot of work to keep things organized and separated.

=head3 Namespace PMC

The C<.namespace> directive that we've seen sets the current namespace. In
PIR code, we have multiple ways to address a namespace:

  # Get namespace "a/b/c" starting at the root namespace
  $P0 = get_root_namespace ["a" ; "b" ; "c"]

  # Get namespace "a/b/c" starting in the current HLL namespace.
  $P0 = get_hll_namespace ["a" ; "b" ; "c"]
  # Same
  $P0 = get_root_namespace ["hll" ; "a" ; "b" ; "c"]

  # Get namespace "a/b/c" starting in the current namespace
  $P0 = get_namespace ["a" ; "b" ; "c"]

Once we have a namespace PMC we can retrieve global variables and
subroutine PMCs from it using the following functions:

  $P1 = get_global $S0            # Get global in current namespace
  $P1 = get_global ["Foo"], $S0   # Get global in namespace "Foo"
  $P1 = get_global $P0, $S0       # Get global in $P0 namespace PMC

=head3 Operations on the Namespace PMC

We've seen above how to find a Namespace PMC. Once you have it, there are a
few things you can do with it. You can find methods and variables that are
stored in the namespace, or you can add new ones:

  $P0 = get_namespace
  $P0.'add_namespace'($P1)      # Add Namespace $P1 to $P0
  $P1 = $P0.'find_namespace'("MyOtherNamespace")

  # Find namespace "MyNamespace" in $P0, create it if it
  #    doesn't exist
  $P1 = $P0.'make_namespace'("MyNamespace")

  $P0.'add_sub'("MySub", $P2)   # Add Sub PMC $P2 to the namespace
  $P1 = $P0.'find_sub'("MySub") # Find it

  $P0.'add_var'("MyVar", $P3)   # Add variable "MyVar" in $P3
  $P1 = $P0.'find_var'("MyVar") # Find it

  # Return the name of Namespace $P0 as a ResizableStringArray
  $P3 = $P0.'get_name'()

  # Find the parent namespace that contains this one:
  $P5 = $P0.'get_parent'()

  # Get the Class PMC associated with this namespace:
  $P6 = $P0.'get_class'()

There are a few other operations that can be done on Namespaces, but none
as interesting as these. We'll talk about Namespaces throughout the rest
of this chapter.


=head2 Classes and Objects

This section revolves around one complete example that defines a
class, instantiates objects, and uses them. The whole example is
included at the end of the section.

=head3 Class declaration

Z<CHP-9-SECT-12.1>

X<classes;in PIR>
The C<newclass>X<newclass opcode (PIR)> opcode defines a new class.
It takes two arguments, the name of the class and the destination
register for the class PMC. All classes (and objects) inherit from the
C<ParrotClass> PMCX<ParrotClass PMC>, which is the core of the Parrot
object system.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    newclass $P1, "Foo"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

To instantiate a new object of a particular class, you first look up
the integer value for the class type with the C<find_type> opcode,
then create an object of that type with the C<new> opcode:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    find_type I1, "Foo"
    new P3I I1

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

The C<new> opcode also checks to see if the class defines a
method named "__init" and calls it if it exists.

=head3 Attributes

Z<CHP-9-SECT-12.2>

X<attributes;in PIR>
X<classes;attributes>
The C<addattribute> opcode creates a slot in the class for an
attribute (sometimes known as an I<instance variable>) and associates
it with a name:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    addattribute $P1, ".i"                # Foo.i

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

This chunk of code
from the C<__init> method looks up the position of the first
attribute, creates a C<Int> PMC, and stores it as the first
attribute:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    classoffset $I0, $P2, "Foo"    # first "Foo" attribute of object P2
    new $P6, "Int"                 # create storage for the attribute
    setattribute $P2, $I0, $P6     # store the first attribute

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

The C<classoffset> opcodeX<classoffset opcode (PIR)> takes a PMC
containing an object and the name of its class, and returns an integer
index for the position of the first attribute. The C<setattribute>
opcode uses the integer index to store a PMC value in one of the
object's attribute slots. This example initializes the first
attribute. The second attribute would be at C<I0 + 1>, the third
attribute at C<I0 + 2>, etc:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    inc $I0
    setattribute $P2, $I0, $P7       # store next attribute
    #...

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

There is also support for named parameters with fully qualified
parameter names (although this is a little bit slower than getting
the class offset once and accessing several attributes by index):

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    new $P6, "Int"
    setattribute $P2, "Foo\x0.i", $P6   # store the attribute

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

You use the same integer index to retrieve the value of an attribute.
The C<getattribute>X<getattribute opcode (PIR)> opcode takes an object and
an index as arguments and returns the attribute PMC at that position:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    classoffset $I0, $P2, "Foo"         # first "Foo" attribute of object P2
    getattribute $P10, $P2, $I0         # indexed get of attribute

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

or

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    getattribute $P10, $P2, "Foo\x0.i"  # named get

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

To set the value of an attribute PMC, first retrieve it with
C<getattribute> and then assign to the returned PMC. Because PMC
registers are only pointers to values, you don't need to store the PMC
again after you modify its value:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    getattribute $P10, $P2, $I0
    set $P10, $I5

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

=head3 Methods

Z<CHP-9-SECT-12.3>

X<methods;in PIR>
X<classes;methods>
X<classes;namespaces>
Methods in PIR are just subroutines installed in the namespace of the
class. You define a method with the C<.pcc_sub> directive before the
label:

=begin PIR_INVALID_FRAGMENT

  .pcc_sub _half:                 # I5 = self."_half"()
    classoffset I0, P2, "Foo"
    getattribute P10, P2, I0
    set I5, P10                   # get value
    div I5, 2
    invoke P1

=end PIR_INVALID_FRAGMENT

This routine returns half of the value of the first attribute of the
object. Method calls use the Parrot calling conventions so they always
pass the I<invocant> object (often called I<self>) in C<P2>. Invoking
the return continuation in C<P1> returns control to the caller.

The C<.pcc_sub> directive automatically stores the subroutine as a
global in the current namespace. The C<.namespace> directive sets the
current namespace:

=begin PIR

  .namespace [ "Foo" ]

=end PIR

If the namespace is explicitly set to an empty string or key, then the
subroutine is stored in the outermost namespace.

The C<callmethodcc>X<callmethodcc opcode (PIR)> opcode makes a method
call. It follows the Parrot calling conventions, so it expects to
find the invocant object in C<P2>, the method object in C<P0>, etc. It
adds one bit of magic, though. If you pass the name of the method in
C<S0>, C<callmethodcc> looks up that method name in the invocant
object and stores the method object in C<P0> for you:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    set $S0, "_half"            # set method name
    set $P2, $P3                # the object
    callmethodcc                # create return continuation, call
    print $I5                   # result of method call
    print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

The C<callmethodcc> opcode also generates a return continuation and
stores it in C<P1>. The C<callmethod> opcode doesn't generate a return
continuation, but is otherwise identical to C<callmethodcc>. Just like
ordinary subroutine calls, you have to preserve and restore any
registers you want to keep after a method call. Whether you store
individual registers, register frames, or half register frames is up
to you.

=head4 Overriding vtable functions

Z<CHP-9-SECT-12.3.1>

Every object inherits a default set of I<vtable> functions from the
C<ParrotObject> PMC, but you can also override them with your own
methods. The vtable functions have predefined names that start with a
double underscore "__". The following code defines a method named
C<__init> in the C<Foo> class that initializes the first attribute of
the object with an integer:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

  .sub __init:
    classoffset I0, P2, "Foo"     # lookup first attribute position
    new P6, "Int"                 # create storage for the attribute
    setattribute P2, I0, P6       # store the first attribute
    invoke P1                     # return

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

Ordinary methods have to be called explicitly, but the vtable
functions are called implicitly in many different contexts. Parrot
saves and restores registers for you in these calls. The C<__init>
method is called whenever a new object is constructed:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    find_type I1, "Foo"
    new P3, I1          # call __init if it exists

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

A few other vtable functions in the complete code example for this
section are C<__set_integer_native>, C<__add>, C<__get_integer>,
C<__get_string>, and C<__increment>. The C<set> opcode calls Foo's
C<__set_integer_native> vtable function when its destination register
is a C<Foo> object and the source register is a native integer:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    set $P3, 30          # call __set_integer_native method

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

The C<add> opcode calls Foo's C<__add> vtable function when it adds
two C<Foo> objects:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    new $P4, $I1          # same with P4
    set $P4, $12
    new $P5, $I1          # create a new store for add

    add $P5, $P3, $P4     # __add method

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

The C<inc> opcode calls Foo's C<__increment> vtable function when it
increments a C<Foo> object:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    inc $P3              # __increment

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Foo's C<__get_integer> and C<__get_string> vtable functions are called
whenever an integer or string value is retrieved from a C<Foo> object:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    set $I10, $P5         # __get_integer
    #...
    print $P5            # calls __get_string, prints 'fortytwo'

=end PIR_FRAGMENT


=head3 Inheritance

Z<CHP-9-SECT-12.4>

X<inheritance;in PIR>
X<classes;inheritance>
The C<subclass>X<subclass opcode (PIR)> opcode creates a new class that
inherits methods and attributes from another class. It takes 3
arguments: the destination register for the new class, a register
containing the parent class, and the name of the new class:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    subclass $P3, $P1, "Bar"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

X<multiple inheritance; in PIR>
For multiple inheritance, the C<addparent>X<addparent opcode (PIR)>
opcode adds additional parents to a subclass.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  newclass $P4, "Baz"
  addparent $P3, $P4

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

To override an inherited method, define a method with the same name in
the namespace of the subclass. The following code overrides Bar's
C<__increment> method so it decrements the value instead of
incrementing it:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

  .namespace [ "Bar" ]

  .sub __increment:
    classoffset I0, P2, "Foo"     # get Foo's attribute slot offset
    getattribute P10, P2, I0      # get the first Foo attribute
    dec P10                       # the evil line
    invoke P1

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

Notice that the attribute inherited from C<Foo> can only be looked up
with the C<Foo> class name, not the C<Bar> class name. This preserves
the distinction between attributes that belong to the class and
inherited attributes.

Object creation for subclasses is the same as for ordinary classes:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    find_type $I1, "Bar"
    new $P5, $I1

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

Calls to inherited methods are just like calls to methods defined in
the class:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    set $P5, 42                  # inherited __set_integer_native
    inc $P5                      # overridden __increment
    print $P5                    # prints 41 as Bar's __increment decrements
    print "\n"

    set $S0, "_half"             # set method name
    set $P2, $P5                 # the object
    callmethodcc                 # create return continuation, call
    print $I5
    print "\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

=head3 Additional Object Opcodes

Z<CHP-9-SECT-12.5>

The C<isa> and C<can> instructuions are also useful when working with
objects. C<isa> checks whether an object belongs to or
inherits from a particular class. C<can> checks whether
an object has a particular method. Both return a true or false value.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

    $I0 = isa $P3, "Foo"         # 1
    $I0 = isa $P3, "Bar"         # 1
    $I0 = can $P3, "add"         # 1

=end PIR_FRAGMENT


It may seem more appropriate for a discussion of PIR's support for classes
and objects to reside in its own chapter, instead of appearing in a generic
chapter about PIR programming "basics". However, part of PIR's core
functionality is its support for object-oriented programming. PIR doesn't
use all the fancy syntax as other OO languages, and it doesn't even support
all the features that most modern OO languages have. What PIR does have is
support for some of the basic structures and abilities, the necessary subset
to construct richer and higher-level object systems.


=head3 Attributes

Classes and subclasses can be given attributes N<in addition to methods,
which we will talk about in the next chapter> which are named data fields.
Attributes are created with the C<addattribute> opcode, and can be set
and retrieved with the C<setattribute> and C<getattribute> opcodes
respectively:

  # Create the new class with two attributes
  $P0 = newclass 'MyClass'
  addattribute $P0, 'First'
  addattribute $P0, 'Second'

  # Create a new item of type MyClass
  $P1 = new 'MyClass'

  # Set values to the attributes
  setattribute $P1, 'First', 'First Value'
  setattribute $P1, 'Second', 'Second Value'

  # Get the attribute values
  $S0 = getattribute $P1, 'First'
  $S1 = getattribute $P1, 'Second'

Those values added as attributes don't need to be strings, even though
both of the ones in the example are. They can be integers, numbers
or PMCs too.

=head3 Methods

PIR provides syntax to simplify writing methods and method calls for
object-oriented programming. We've seen some method calls in the examples
above, especially when we were talking about the interfaces to certain PMC
types. We've also seen a little bit of information about classes and objects
in the previous chapter. PIR allows you to define your own classes, and with
those classes you can define method interfaces to them. Method calls follow
the same Parrot calling conventions that we have seen above, including all the
various parameter configurations, lexical scoping, and other aspects we have
already talked about.

The second type of class can be defined in PIR at runtime. We saw some
examples of this in the last chapter using the C<newclass> and C<subclass>
opcodes. We also talked about class attribute values. Now, we're going to talk
about associating subroutines with these classes, and they're called
I<methods>. Methods are just like other normal subroutines with two major
changes: they are marked with the C<:method> flag, and they exist in a
I<namespace>. Before we can talk about methods, we need to discuss
namespaces first.

Z<CHP-4-SECT-2.2>

Methods are just like subroutines, except
they are invoked on a object PMC, and that PMC is passed as the c<self>
parameter.

The basic syntax for a method call is similar to the single line
subroutine call above. It takes a variable for the invocant PMC and a
string with the name of the method:

  object."methodname"(arguments)

Notice that the name of the method must be contained in quotes. If the
name of the method is not contained in quotes, it's treated as a named
variable that does. Here's an example:

  .local string methname = "Foo"
  object.methname()               # Same as object."Foo"()
  object."Foo"()                  # Same

The invocant can be a variable or register, and the method name can be
a literal string, string variable, or method object PMC.

=head3 Defining Methods

Methods are defined like any other subroutine except with two major
differences: They must be inside a namespace named after the class
they are a part of, and they must use the C<:method> flag.

  .namespace [ "MyClass"]

  .sub "MyMethod" :method
    ...

Inside the method, the invocant object can be accessed using the C<self>
keyword. C<self> isn't the only name you can call this value, however.
You can also use the C<:invocant> flag to define a new name for the invocant
object:

(See TT #483)

=begin PIR_INVALID

  .sub "MyMethod" :method
    $S0 = self                    # Already defined as "self"
    say $S0
  .end

  .sub "MyMethod2" :method
    .param pmc item :invocant     # "self" is now called "item"
    $S0 = item
    say $S0
  .end

=end PIR_INVALID

This example defines two methods in the C<Foo> class. It calls one
from the main body of the subroutine and the other from within the
first method:

=begin PIR

  .sub main
    .local pmc class
    .local pmc obj
    newclass class, "Foo"       # create a new Foo class
    new obj, "Foo"              # instantiate a Foo object
    obj."meth"()                # call obj."meth" which is actually
    print "done\n"              # in the "Foo" namespace
  .end

  .namespace [ "Foo" ]          # start namespace "Foo"

  .sub meth :method             # define Foo::meth global
     print "in meth\n"
     $S0 = "other_meth"         # method names can be in a register too
     self.$S0()                 # self is the invocant
  .end

  .sub other_meth :method       # define another method
     print "in other_meth\n"    # as above Parrot provides a return
  .end                          # statement

=end PIR

Each method call looks up the method name in the object's class namespace.
The C<.sub> directive automatically makes a symbol table entry for the
subroutine in the current namespace.

When a C<.sub> is declared as a C<:method>, it automatically creates a
local variable named C<self> and assigns it the object passed in
C<P2>. You don't need to write C<.param pmc self> to get it, it comes
free with the method.

You can pass multiple arguments to a method and retrieve multiple
return values just like a single line subroutine call:

  (res1, res2) = obj."method"(arg1, arg2)


=head3 Introspection

The details about various PMC classes are managed by the Class PMC. Class PMCs
contain information about the class, available methods, the inheritance
hierarchy of the class, and various other details. Classes can be created
with the C<newclass> opcode:

  $P0 = newclass "MyClass"

Once we have created the class PMC, we can instantiate objects of that class
using the C<new> opcode. The C<new> opcode takes either the class name or the
Class PMC as an argument:

  $P1 = new $P0        # $P0 is the Class PMC
  $P2 = new "MyClass"  # Same

The C<new> opcode can create two different types of PMC. The first type are
the built-in core PMC classes. The built-in PMCs are written in C and cannot
be extended from PIR without subclassing. However, you can also create
user-defined PMC types in PIR. User-defined PMCs use the Object PMC type for
instantiation. Object PMCs are used for all user-defined type and keep track
of the methods and VTABLE override definitions. We're going to talk about
methods and VTABLE overrides in the next chapter.

=head2 Subclassing PMCs

Existing built-in PMC types can be subclassed to associate additional data
and methods with that PMC type. Subclassed PMC types act like their PMC
base types, by sharing the same VTABLE methods and underlying data types.
However, the subclass can define additional methods and attribute data
storage. If necessary new VTABLE interfaces can be defined in PIR and old
VTABLE methods can be overridden using PIR. We'll talk about defining
methods and VTABLE interface overrides in the next chapter.

Creating a new subclass of an existing PMC class is done using the
C<subclass> keyword:

  # create an anonymous subclass
  $P0 = subclass 'ResizablePMCArray'

  # create a subclass named "MyArray"
  $P0 = subclass 'ResizablePMCArray', 'MyArray'

This returns a C<Class> PMC which can be used to create and modify the
class by adding attributes or creating objects of that class. You can also
use the new class PMC to create additional subclasses:

  $P0 = subclass 'ResizablePMCArray', 'MyArray'
  $P1 = subclass $P0, 'MyOtherArray'

Once you have created these classes, you can create them like normal with
the C<new> keyword:

  $P0 = new 'MyArray'
  $P1 = new 'MyOtherArray'



=head3 Vtable Overrides

PMCs all subscribe to a common interface of functions called X<VTABLE>
VTABLEs. Every PMC implements the same set of these interfaces, which
perform very specific low-level tasks on the PMC. The term VTABLE was
originally a shortened form of the name "virtual function table",
although that name isn't used any more by the developers, or in any of
the documentation. The virtual functions in the VTABLE, called X<VTABLE
interfaces> VTABLE interfaces, are similar to ordinary functions and
methods in many respects. VTABLE interfaces are occasionally called
"VTABLE functions", or "VTABLE methods" or even "VTABLE entries" in
casual conversation. A quick comparison shows that VTABLE interfaces
are not really subroutines or methods in the way that those terms have
been used throughout the rest of Parrot. Like methods on an object,
VTABLE interfaces are defined for a specific class of PMC, and can be
invoked on any member of that class. Likewise, in a VTABLE interface
declaration, the C<self> keyword is used to describe the object that
it is invoked upon. That's where the similarities end, however. Unlike
ordinary subroutines or methods, VTABLE methods cannot be invoked
directly, they are also not inherited through class hierarchies like
how methods are. With all this terminology discussion out of the way,
we can start talking about what VTABLES are and how they are used in
Parrot.

VTABLE interfaces are the primary way that data in the PMC is accessed
and modified. VTABLES also provide a way to invoke the PMC if it's a
subroutine or subroutine-like PMC. VTABLE interfaces are not called
directly from PIR code, but are instead called internally by Parrot to
implement specific opcodes and behaviors. For instance, the C<invoke>
opcode calls the C<invoke> VTABLE interface of the subroutine PMC,
while the C<inc> opcode on a PMC calls the C<increment> VTABLE
interface on that PMC. What VTABLE interface overrides do, in essence,
is to allow the programmer to change the very way that Parrot accesses
PMC data in the most fundamental way, and changes the very way that the
opcodes act on that data.

PMCs, as we will look at more closely in later chapters, are typically
implemented using X<PMC Script> PMC Script, a layer of syntax and macros
over ordinary C code. A X<PMC Compiler> PMC compiler program converts the
PMC files into C code for compilation as part of the ordinary build
process. However, VTABLE interfaces can be written I<and overwritten> in
PIR using the C<:vtable> flag on a subroutine declaration. This technique
is used most commonly when subclassing an existing PMC class in PIR code
to create a new data type with custom access methods.

VTABLE interfaces are declared with the C<:vtable> flag:

  .sub 'set_integer' :vtable
      #set the integer value of the PMC here
  .end

in which case the subroutine must have the same name as the VTABLE
interface it is intended to implement. VTABLE interfaces all have very
specific names, and you can't override one with just any arbitrary name.
However, if you would like to name the function something different but
still use it as a VTABLE interface, you could add an additional name
parameter to the flag:

  .sub 'MySetInteger' :vtable('set_integer')
      #set the integer value of the PMC here
  .end

VTABLE interfaces are often given the C<:method> flag also, so that they can
be used directly in PIR code as methods, in addition to being used by Parrot
as VTABLE interfaces. This means we can have the following:

  .namespace [ "MyClass" ]

  .sub 'ToString' :vtable('get_string') :method
      $S0 = "hello!"
      .return($S0)
  .end

  .namespace [ "OtherClass" ]

  .local pmc myclass = new "MyClass"
  say myclass                 # say converts to string internally
  $S0 = myclass               # Convert to a string, store in $S0
  $S0 = myclass.'ToString'()  # The same

Inside a VTABLE interface definition, the C<self> local variable contains
the PMC on which the VTABLE interface is invoked, just like in a method
declaration.


=head3 Roles

As we've seen above and in the previous chapter, Class PMCs and NameSpace
PMCs work to keep classes and methods together in a logical way. There is
another factor to add to this mix: The Role PMC.

Roles are like classes, but don't stand on their own. They represent
collections of methods and VTABLES that can be added into an existing class.
Adding a role to a class is called I<composing> that role, and any class
that has been composed with a role C<does> that role.

Roles are created as PMC and can be manipulated through opcodes and methods
like other PMCs:

  $P0 = new 'Role'
  $P1 = get_global "MyRoleSub"
  $P0.'add_method'("MyRoleSub", $P1)

Once we've created a role and added methods to it, we can add that role to
a class, or even to another role:

  $P1 = new 'Role'
  $P2 = new 'Class'
  $P1.'add_role'($P0)
  $P2.'add_role'($P0)
  add_role $P2, $P0    # Same!

Now that we have added the role, we can check whether we implement it:

  $I0 = does $P2, $P0  # Yes

We can get a list of roles from our Class PMC:

  $P3 = $P2.'roles'()

Roles are very useful for ensuring that related classes all implement a common
interface.  


=head2 Filehandles

Like almost everything else in Parrot, input and output are handled by PMCs.

We've seen C<print> and C<say>. C<print> prints
the given string argument, or the stringified form of the argument, if it's
not a string, to standard output. C<say> does the same thing but also appends
a trailing newline to it. Another opcode worth mentioning is the C<printerr>
opcode, which prints an argument to the standard error output instead.

We can read values from the standard input using the C<read> and C<readline>
ops. C<read> takes an integer value and returns a string with that many
characters. C<readline> reads an entire line of input from the standard
input, and returns the string without the trailing newline. Here is a simple
echo program that reads in characters from the user and echos them to
standard output:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main'
    loop_top:
      $S0 = read 10
      print $S0
      goto loop_top
  .end

=end PIR

The ops we have seen so far are useful if all your I/O operations are limited
to the standard streams. However, there are plenty of other places where
you might want to get data from and send data to. Things like files, sockets,
and databases all might need to have data sent to them. These things can be
done by using a file handle.

Filehandles are PMCs that describe a file and keep track of an I/O operations
internal state. We can get Filehandles for the standard streams using dedicated
opcodes:

  $P0 = getstdin    # Standard input handle
  $P1 = getstdout   # Standard output handle
  $P2 = getstderr   # Standard error handle

If we have a file, we can create a handle to it using the C<open> op:

  $P0 = open "my/file/name.txt"

We can also specify the exact mode that the file handle will be in:

  $P0 = open "my/file/name.txt", "wa"

The mode string at the end should be familiar to C programmers, because they
are mostly the same values:

  r  : read
  w  : write
  wa : append
  p  : pipe

So if we want a handle that we can read and write to, we write the mode string
C<"rw">. If we want to be able to read and write to it, but we don't want
write operations to overwrite the existing contents, we use C<"rwa"> instead.

When we are done with a filehandle that we've created, we can shut it down
with the C<close> op. Notice that we don't want to be closing any of the
standard streams.

  close $P0

With a filehandle, we can perform all the same operations as we could earlier,
but we pass the filehandle as an additional argument to tell the op where to
write or read the data from.

  print "hello"       # Write "hello!" to STDOUT

  $P0 = getstdout
  print $P0, "hello"  # Same, but more explicit

  say $P0, " world!"  # say to STDOUT

  $P1 = open "myfile.txt", "wa"
  print $P1, "foo"    # Write "foo" to myfile.txt

=head2 Filehandle PMCs

Let's see a little example of a program that reads in data from a file, and
prints it to STDOUT.

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main'
    $P0 = getstdout
    $P1 = open "myfile.txt", "r"
    loop_top:
      $S0 = readline $P1
      print $P0, $S0
      if $P1 goto loop_top
    close $P1
  .end

=end PIR

This example shows that treating a filehandle PMC like a boolean value
returns whether or not we have reached the end of the file. A true return
value means there is more file to read. A false return value means we are at
the end. In addition to this behavior, Filehandle PMCs have a number of methods
that can be used to perform various operations.

=over 4

=item C<$P0.'open'(STRING filename, STRING mode)>

Opens the filehandle. Takes two optional strings: the name of the file to open
and the open mode. If no filename is given, the previous filename associated
with the filehandle is opened. If no mode is given, the previously-used mode
is used.

  $P0 = new 'Filehandle'
  $P0.'open'("myfile.txt", "r")

  $P0 = open "myfile.txt", "r"   # Same!

The C<open> opcode internally creates a new filehandle PMC and calls the
C<'open'()> method on it. So even though the above two code snippets act in
an identical way, the later one is a little more concise to write. The caveat
is that the C<open> opcode creates a new PMC for every call, while the
C<'open'()> method call can reuse an existing filehandle PMC for a new file.

=item C<$P0.'isatty'()>

Returns a boolean value whether the filehandle is a TTY terminal

=item C<$P0.'close'()>

Closes the filehandle. Can be reopened with C<.'open'> later.

  $P0.'close'()

  close $P0   # Same

The C<close> opcode calls the C<'close'()> method on the Filehandle PMC
internally, so these two calls are equivalent.

=item C<$P0.'is_closed'()>

Returns true if the filehandle is closed, false if it is opened.

=item C<$P0.'read'(INTVAL length)>

Reads C<length> bytes from the filehandle.

  $S0 = read $P0, 10

  $P0.'read'(10)

The two calls are equivalent, and the C<read> opcode calls the C<'read'()>
method internally.

=item C<$P0.'readline'()>

Reads an entire line (up to a newline character or EOF) from the filehandle.

=item C<$P0.'readline_interactive'(STRING prompt)>

Displays the string C<prompt> and then reads a line of input.

=item C<$P0.'readall'(STRING name)>

Reads the entire file C<name> into a string. If the filehandle is closed,
it will open the file given by C<name>, read the entire file, and then close
the handle. If the filehandle is already open, C<name> should not be passed
(it is an optional parameter).

=item C<$P0.'flush'()>

Flushes the buffer

=item C<$P0.'print'(PMC to_print)>

Prints the given value to the filehandle. The C<print> opcode uses the
C<'print'()> method internally.

  print "Hello"

  $P0 = getstdout
  print $P0, "Hello!"    # Same

  $P0.'print'("Hello!")  # Same

=item C<$P0.'puts'(STRING to_print)>

Prints the given string value to the filehandle

=item C<$P0.'buffer_type'(STRING new_type)>

If C<new_type> is given, changes the buffer to the new type. If it is not,
returns the current type. Acceptable types are:

  unbuffered
  line-buffered
  full-buffered

=item C<$P0.'buffer_size'(INTVAL size)>

If C<size> is given, set the size of the buffer. If not, returns the size of
the current buffer.

=item C<$P0.'mode'()>

Returns the current file access mode.

=item C<$P0.'encoding'(STRING encoding)>

Sets the filehandle's string encoding to C<encoding> if given, returns the
current encoding otherwise.

=item C<$P0.'eof'()>

Returns true if the filehandle is at the end of the current file, false
otherwise.

=item C<$P0.'get_fd'()>

Returns the integer file descriptor of the current file, but only on operating
systems that use file descriptors. Returns C<-1> on systems that do not
support this.

=head2 Exceptions

=head2 Exceptions and Exception Handlers

Z<CHP-9-SECT-8>

X<exceptions>
X<exception handlers>
Exceptions provide a way of calling a piece of code outside the normal
flow of control. They are mainly used for error reporting or cleanup
tasks, but sometimes exceptions are just a funny way to branch from
one code location to another one. The design and implementation of
exceptions in Parrot isn't complete yet, but this section will give
you an idea where we're headed.

Exceptions are objects that hold all the information needed to handle
the exception: the error message, the severity and type of the error,
etc. The class of an exception object indicates the kind of exception
it is.

Exception handlers are derived from continuations. They are ordinary
subroutines that follow the Parrot calling conventions, but are never
explicitly called from within user code. User code pushes an exception
handler onto the control stack with the C<set_eh>X<set_eh opcode (PIR)>
opcode. The system calls the installed exception handler only when an
exception is thrown (perhaps because of code that does division by
zero or attempts to retrieve a global that wasn't stored.)

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    newsub P20, .ExceptionHandler, _handler
    set_eh P20                  # push handler on control stack
    null P10                    # set register to null
    get_global P10, "none"     # may throw exception
    clear_eh                    # pop the handler off the stack
    #...

  _handler:                     # if not, execution continues here
    is_null P10, not_found      # test P10
    #...

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

This example creates a new exception handler subroutine with the
C<newsub> opcode and installs it on the control stack with the
C<set_eh> opcode. It sets the C<P10> register to a null value (so it
can be checked later) and attempts to retrieve the global variable
named C<none>. If the global variable is found, the next statement
(C<clear_eh>) pops the exception handler off the control stack and
normal execution continues. If the C<get_global> call doesn't find
C<none> it throws an exception by pushing an exception object onto the
control stack. When Parrot sees that it has an exception, it pops it
off the control stack and calls the exception handler C<_handler>.

The first exception handler in the control stack sees every exception
thrown. The handler has to examine the exception object and decide
whether it can handle it (or discard it) or whether it should
C<rethrow> the exception to pass it along to an exception handler
deeper in the stack. The C<rethrow>X<rethrow opcode (PIR)> opcode is only
valid in exception handlers. It pushes the exception object back onto
the control stack so Parrot knows to search for the next exception
handler in the stack. The process continues until some exception
handler deals with the exception and returns normally, or until there
are no more exception handlers on the control stack. When the system
finds no installed exception handlers it defaults to a final action,
which normally means it prints an appropriate message and terminates
the program.

When the system installs an exception handler, it creates a return
continuation with a snapshot of the current interpreter context. If
the exception handler just returns (that is, if the exception is
cleanly caught) the return continuation restores the control stack
back to its state when the exception handler was called, cleaning up
the exception handler and any other changes that were made in the
process of handling the exception.

Exceptions thrown by standard Parrot opcodes (like the one thrown by
C<get_global> above or by the C<throw> opcode) are always resumable,
so when the exception handler function returns normally it continues
execution at the opcode immediately after the one that threw the
exception. Other exceptions at the run-loop level are also generally
resumable.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT

  new $P10, 'Exception'    # create new Exception object
  set $P10, 'I die'        # set message attribute
  throw $P10               # throw it

=end PIR_FRAGMENT

Exceptions are designed to work with the Parrot calling conventions.
Since the return addresses of C<bsr> subroutine calls and exception
handlers are both pushed onto the control stack, it's generally a bad
idea to combine the two.


Parrot includes a robust exception mechanism that is not only used internally
to implement a variety of control flow constructs, but is also available for
use directly from PIR code. Exceptions, in as few words as possible, are
error conditions in the program. Exceptions are I<thrown> when an error
occurs, and they can be I<caught> by special routines called I<handlers>. This
enables Parrot to recover from errors in a controlled way, instead of crashing
and terminating the process entirely.

Exceptions, like most other data objects in Parrot, are PMCs. They contain
and provide access to a number of different bits of data about the error,
such as the location where the error was thrown (including complete
backtraces), any annotation information from the file, and other data.

=head3 Throwing Exceptions

Many exceptions are used internally in Parrot to indicate error conditions.
Opcodes such as C<die> and C<warn> throw exceptions internally to do what they
are supposed to do. Other opcodes such as C<div> throw exceptions only when
an error occurs, such as an attempted division by zero.

Exceptions can also be thrown manually using the C<throw> opcode. Here's an
example:

  $P0 = new 'Exception'
  throw $P0

This throws the exception object as an error. If there are any available
handlers in scope, the interpreter will pass the exception object to the
handler and continue execution there. If there are no handlers available,
Parrot will exit.

=head3 Exception Attributes

Since Exceptions are PMC objects, they can contain a number of useful data
items. One such data item is the message:

  $P0 = new 'Exception'
  $P1 = new 'String'
  $P1 = "this is an error message for the exception"
  $P0["message"] = $P1

Another is the severity and the type:

  $P0["severity"] = 1   # An integer value
  $P0["type"] = 2       # Also an Integer

Finally, there is a spot for additional data to be included:

  $P0["payload"] = $P2  # Any arbitrary PMC

=head3 Exception Handlers

Exception handlers are labels in PIR code that can be jumped to when an
exception is thrown. To list a label as an exception handler, the C<push_eh>
opcode is used. All handlers exist on a stack. Pushing a new handler adds it
to the top of the stack, and using the C<pop_eh> opcode pops the handler off
the top of the stack.

  push_eh my_handler
    # something that might cause an error

  my_handler:
    # handle the error here

=head3 Catching Exceptions

The exception PMC that was thrown can be caught using the C<.get_results()>
directive. This returns the Exception PMC object that was thrown from inside
the handler:

  my_handler:
    .local pmc err
    .get_results(err)

With the exception PMC available, the various attributes of that PMC can be
accessed and analyzed for additional information about the error.

=head3 Exception Handler PMCs

Like all other interesting data types in Parrot, exception handlers are a PMC
type. When using the syntax above with C<push_eh LABEL>, the handler PMC
is created internally by Parrot. However, you can create it explicitly too
if you want:

  $P0 = new 'ExceptionHandler'
  set_addr $P0, my_handler
  push_eh $P0
  ...

  my_handler:
    ...

=head3 Rethrowing Exceptions

Exception handlers are nested and are stored in a stack. This is because not
all handlers are intended to handle all exceptions. If a handler cannot deal
with a particular exception, it can C<rethrow> the exception to the next outer handler
handler. If none of the set handlers can handle the exception, the
exception is a fatal error and Parrot will exit.

=head2 Annotations

Annotations are pieces of metadata that can be stored in a bytecode file to
give some information about what the original source code looked like. This
is especially important when dealing with high-level languages. We'll go into
detail about annotations and their use in Chapter 10.

Annotations are created using the c<.annotation> keyword. Annotations consist
of a key/value pair, where the key is a string and the value is an integer,
a number, or a string. Since annotations are stored compactly as constants in
the compiled bytecode, PMCs cannot be used.

  .annotation 'file', 'mysource.lang'
  .annotation 'line', 42
  .annotation 'compiletime', 0.3456

Annotations exist, or are "in force" throughout the entire subroutine,
or until they are redefined. Creating a new annotation with the same name as
an old one overwrites it with the new value. The current hash of annotations
can be retrieved with the C<annotations> opcode:

  .annotation 'line', 1
  $P0 = annotations # {'line' => 1}
  .annotation 'line', 2
  $P0 = annotations # {'line' => 2}

Or, to retrieve a single annotation by name, you can write:

  $I0 = annotations 'line'

=head3 Annotations in Exceptions

Exception objects contain information about the annotations that were in force
when the exception was thrown. These can be retrieved with the
C<'annotation'()>  method of the exception PMC object:

  $I0 = $P0.'annotations'('line')  # only the 'line' annotation
  $P1 = $P0.'annotations'()        # hash of all annotations

Exceptions can also give out a backtrace to try and follow where the program
was exactly when the exception was thrown:

  $P1 = $P0.'backtrace'()

The backtrace PMC is an array of hashes. Each element in the array corresponds
to a function in the current call stack. Each hash has two elements:
C<'annotation'> which is the hash of annotations that were in effect at that
point, and C<'sub'> which is the Sub PMC of that function.

=head2 Events

Z<CHP-9-SECT-9>

An event is a notification that something has happened: a timer
expired, an IO operation finished, a thread sent a message to
another thread, or the user pressed C<Ctrl-C> to interrupt program
execution.

What all of these events have in common is that they arrive
asynchronously. It's generally not safe to interrupt program flow at an
arbitrary point and continue at a different position, so the event is
placed in the
interpreter's task queue. The run loops code regularly checks whether
an event needs to be handled. Event handlers may be an internal piece
of code or a user-defined event handler subroutine.

Events are still experimental in Parrot, so the implementation and
design is subject to change.

=head3 Timers

Z<CHP-9-SECT-9.1>

C<Timer> objects are the replacement for Perl 5's C<alarm> handlers.
They are also a significant improvement. Timers can fire once or
repeatedly, and multiple timers can run independently. The precision
of a timer is limited by the OS Parrot runs on, but it is always more
fine-grained then a whole second. The final syntax isn't yet fixed, so
please consult the documentation for examples.

=head3 Signals

Z<CHP-9-SECT-9.2>

Signal handling is related to events. When Parrot gets a signal it
needs to handle from the OS, it converts that signal into an event and
broadcasts it to all running threads. Each thread independently
decides if it's interested in this signal and, if so, how to respond to it.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    newsub P20, .ExceptionHandler, _handler
    set_eh P20                  # establish signal handler
    print "send SIGINT:\n"
    sleep 2                     # press ^C after you saw start
    print "no SIGINT\n"
    end
  _handler:
    .include "signal.pasm"      # get signal definitions
    print "caught "
    set I0, P5["type"]         # if _type is negative, the ...
    neg I0, I0                  # ... negated type is the signal
    ne I0, .SIGINT, nok
    print "SIGINT\n"
  nok:
    end

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

This example creates a signal handler and pushes it on to the control
stack. It then prompts the user to send a C<SIGINT> from the shell
(this is usually C<Ctrl-C>, but it varies in different shells), and
waits for 2 seconds. If the user doesn't send a SIGINT in 2 seconds
the example just prints "no SIGINT" and ends. If the user does send a
SIGINT, the signal handler catches it, prints out "caught SIGINT" and
ends.N<Currently, only Linux installs a C<SIGINT> C<sigaction>
handler, so this example won't work on other platforms.>

=head2 Threads

Z<CHP-9-SECT-10>

Threads allow multiple pieces of code to run in parallel. This is
useful when you have multiple physical CPUs to share the load of
running individual threads. With a single processor, threads still
provide the feeling of parallelism, but without any improvement in
execution time. Even worse, sometimes using threads on a single
processor will actually slow down your program.

Still, many algorithms can be expressed more easily in terms of
parallel running pieces of code and many applications profit from
taking advantage of multiple CPUs. Threads can vastly simplify
asynchronous programs like internet servers: a thread splits off,
waits for some IO to happen, handles it, and relinquishes the
processor again when it's done.

Parrot compiles in thread support by default (at least, if the
platform provides some kind of support for it). Unlike Perl 5,
compiling with threading support doesn't impose any execution time
penalty for a non-threaded program. Like exceptions and events,
threads are still under development, so you can expect significant
changes in the near future.

As outlined in the previous chapter, Parrot implements three different
threading models. (B<Note>:  As of version 1.0, the C<TQueue> PMC will be
deprecated, rendering the following discussion obsolete.) The following
example uses the third model, which takes advantage of shared data. It uses a
C<TQueue> (thread-safe queue) object to synchronize the two parallel running
threads. This is only a simple example to illustrate threads, not a typical
usage of threads (no-one really wants to spawn two threads just to print out a
simple string).

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    get_global P5, "_th1"              # locate thread function
    new P2, "ParrotThread"              # create a new thread
    find_method P0, P2, "thread3"       # a shared thread's entry
    new P7, "TQueue"                    # create a Queue object
    new P8, "Int"                       # and a Int
    push P7, P8                         # push the Int onto queue
    new P6, "String"                    # create new string
    set P6, "Js nte artHce\n"
    set I3, 3                           # thread function gets 3 args
    invoke                              # _th1.run(P5,P6,P7)
    new P2, "ParrotThread"              # same for a second thread
    get_global P5, "_th2"
    set P6, "utaohrPro akr"             # set string to 2nd thread's
    invoke                              # ... data, run 2nd thread too
    end                                 # Parrot joins both

  .pcc_sub _th1:                        # 1st thread function
  w1: sleep 0.001                       # wait a bit and schedule
    defined I1, P7                      # check if queue entry is ...
    unless I1, w1                       # ... defined, yes: it's ours
    set S5, P6                          # get string param
    substr S0, S5, I0, 1                # extract next char
    print S0                            # and print it
    inc I0                              # increment char pointer
    shift P8, P7                        # pull item off from queue
    if S0, w1                           # then wait again, if todo
    invoke P1                           # done with string

  .pcc_sub _th2:                        # 2nd thread function
  w2: sleep 0.001
    defined I1, P7                      # if queue entry is defined
    if I1, w2                           # then wait
    set S5, P6
    substr S0, S5, I0, 1                # if not print next char
    print S0
    inc I0
    new P8, "Int"                       # and put a defined entry
    push P7, P8                         # onto the queue so that
    if S0, w2                           # the other thread will run
    invoke P1                           # done with string

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

This example creates a C<ParrotThread> object and calls its C<thread3>
method, passing three arguments: a PMC for the C<_th1> subroutine in
C<P5>, a string argument in C<P6>, and a C<TQueue> object in C<P7>
containing a single integer. Remember from the earlier section
"Parrot calling conventions" that registers 5-15
hold the arguments for a subroutine or method call and C<I3> stores
the number of arguments. The thread object is passed in C<P2>.

This call to the C<thread3> method spawns a new thread to run the
C<_th1> subroutine. The main body of the code then creates a second
C<ParrotThread> object in C<P2>, stores a different subroutine in
C<P5>, sets C<P6> to a new string value, and then calls the C<thread3>
method again, passing it the same C<TQueue> object as the first
thread. This method call spawns a second thread. The main body of code
then ends, leaving the two threads to do the work.

At this point the two threads have already started running. The first
thread (C<_th1>) starts off by sleeping for a 1000th of a second. It
then checks if the C<TQueue> object contains a value. Since it
contains a value when the thread is first called, it goes ahead and
runs the body of the subroutine. The first thing this does is shift
the element off the C<TQueue>. It then pulls one character off a copy
of the string parameter using C<substr>, prints the character,
increments the current position (C<I0>) in the string, and loops back
to the C<w1> label and sleeps. Since the queue doesn't have any
elements now, the subroutine keeps sleeping.

Meanwhile, the second thread (C<_th2>) also starts off by sleeping for
a 1000th of a second. It checks if the shared C<TQueue> object
contains a defined value but unlike the first thread it only continues
sleeping if the queue does contain a value. Since the queue contains a
value when the second thread is first called, the subroutine loops
back to the C<w2> label and continues sleeping. It keeps sleeping
until the first thread shifts the integer off the queue, then runs the
body of the subroutine. The body pulls one character off a copy of the
string parameter using C<substr>, prints the character, and increments
the current position in the string. It then creates a new
C<Int>, pushes it onto the shared queue, and loops back to the
C<w2> label again to sleep. The queue has an element now, so the
second thread keeps sleeping, but the first thread runs through its
loop again.

The two threads alternate like this, printing a character and marking
the queue so the next thread can run, until there are no more
characters in either string. At the end, each subroutine invokes the
return continuation in C<P1> which terminates the thread. The
interpreter waits for all threads to terminate in the cleanup phase
after the C<end> in the main body of code.

The final printed result (as you might have guessed) is:

  Just another Parrot Hacker

The syntax for threads isn't carved in stone and the implementation
still isn't finished but as this example shows, threads are working
now and already useful.

Several methods are useful when working with threads. The C<join>
method belongs to the C<ParrotThread> class. When it's called on a
C<ParrotThread> object, the calling code waits until the thread
terminates.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    new $P2, "ParrotThread"       # create a new thread
    set $I5, $P2                  # get thread ID

    find_method $P0, $P2, "join"  # get the join method...
    invoke                        # ...and join (wait for) the thread
    set $P16, $P5                 # the return result of the thread

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

C<kill> and C<detach> are interpreter methods, so you have to grab the
current interpreter object before you can look up the method object.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

    set $I5, $P2                  # get thread ID of thread P2
    getinterp $P3                 # get this interpreter object
    find_method $P0, $P3, "kill"  # get kill method
    invoke                        # kill thread with ID I5

    find_method $P0, $P3, "detach"
    invoke                      # detach thread with ID I5

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

By the time you read this, some of these combinations of statements
and much of the threading syntax above may be reduced to a simpler set
of opcodes.

=head2 Loading Bytecode

Z<CHP-9-SECT-11>

In addition to running Parrot bytecode on the command-line, you can
also load pre-compiled bytecode directly into your PIR source file.
The C<load_bytecode>X<load_bytecode opcode (PIR)> opcode takes a single
argument: the name of the bytecode file to load. So, if you create a
file named F<file.pasm> containing a single subroutine:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

  # file.pasm
  .sub _sub2:               # .sub stores a global sub
     print "in sub2\n"
     invoke P1

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

and compile it to bytecode using the C<-o> command-line switch:

  $ parrot -o file.pbc file.pasm

You can then load the compiled bytecode into F<main.pasm> and directly
call the subroutine defined in F<file.pasm>:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

  # main.pir
  main:
    load_bytecode "file.pbc"    # compiled file.pasm
    get_global $P0, "_sub2"
    invokecc

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

The C<load_bytecode> opcode also works with source files, as long as
Parrot has a compiler registered for that type of file:

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

  # main2.pir
  main:
    load_bytecode "file.pasm"  # PIR source code
    set_global $P0, "_sub2"
    invokecc

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

Subroutines marked with C<:load> run as soon as they're loaded (before
C<load_bytecode> returns), rather than waiting to be called. A
subroutine marked with C<:main> will always run first, no matter what
name you give it or where you define it in the file.

=begin PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

  # file3.pir
  .sub :load                    # mark the sub as to be run
    print "file3\n"
    invoke $P1                   # return

  # main3.pasm
  first:                        # first is never invoked
    print "never\n"
    invoke $P1

  .sub :main                    # because _main is marked as the
    print "main\n"              # MAIN entry of program execution
    load_bytecode "file3.pasm"
    print "back\n"

=end PIR_FRAGMENT_INVALID

This example uses both C<:load> and C<:main>. Because the C<main>
subroutine is defined with C<:main> it will execute first even though
another subroutine comes before it in the file. C<main> prints a
line, loads the PIR source file, and then prints another line.
Because C<_entry> in F<file3.pasm> is marked with C<:load> it runs
before C<load_bytecode> returns, so the final output is:

  main
  file3
  back
