=head1 Parrot Intermediate Representation

Z<CHP-3>

X<Parrot Intermediate Representation;;(see PIR)>
X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation)>

Parrot Intermediate Representation (PIR) is Parrot's native low-level
language.N<Parrot also has a pure native assembly language called PASM,
described in Chapter 9.> PIR is fundamentally an assembly language, but
it has some higher-level features such as operator syntax, syntactic
sugar for subroutine and method calls, automatic register allocation,
and more friendly conditional syntax.  PIR is commonly used to write
Parrot libraries -- including some of Parrot's compilers -- and is the
target form when compiling high-level languages to Parrot.

Even so, PIR is more rigid and "close to the machine" then some higher-level
languages like C. X<.pir files> Files containing PIR code use the F<.pir>
extension.

=head2 Basics

PIR has a relatively simple syntax. Every line is a comment, a label, a
statement, or a directive. Each statement or directive stands on its own line.
There is no end-of-line symbol (such as a semicolon in other languages).

=head3 Comments

X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation); comments>
X<comments (PIR)>
A comment begins with the C<#> symbol, and continues until the end of the line.
Comments can stand alone on a line or follow a statement or directive.

    # This is a regular comment. The PIR
    # interpreter ignores this.

X<Pod documentation>
PIR also treats inline documentation in Pod format as a comment. An
equals sign as the first character of a line marks the start of a Pod
block.  A C<=cut> marker signals the end of a Pod block.

  =head2

  This is Pod documentation, and is treated like a
  comment. The PIR interpreter ignores this.

  =cut

=head3 Labels

Z<CHP-3-SECT-4>

X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);labels> X<labels (PIR)> A label
attaches a name to a line of code so other statements can refer to it.
Labels can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. By convention,
labels use all capital letters to stand out from the rest of the source
code. A label can be precede a line of code, though outdenting labels on
separate lines improves readability:

  GREET:
      say "'Allo, 'allo, 'allo."

=head3 Statements

Z<CHP-3-SECT-1>

X<statements (PIR)>
X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);statements>
A statement is either an opcode or syntactic sugar for one or more opcodes. An
opcode is a native instruction for the virtual machine; it consists of the name
of the instruction followed by zero or more arguments.

  say "Norwegian Blue"

PIR also provides higher-level constructs, including symbol operators:

  $I1 = 2 + 5

Under the hood, these special statement forms are just syntactic sugar for
regular opcodes. The C<+> symbol corresponds to the C<add> opcode, the C<->
symbol to the C<sub> opcode, and so on. The previous example is equivalent to:

  add $I1, 2, 5

=head3 Directives

Directives look similar to opcodes, but they begin with a period (C<.>).
Parrot's parser handles them specially. Some directives specify actions
that occur at compile time. Other directives represent complex
operations that require the generation of multiple instructions.  The
C<.local> directive, for example, declares a named variable.

  .local string hello

PIR also has a macro facility to create user-defined directives.

=head3 Literals

Integers and floating point numbers are numeric literals. They can be positive
or negative.

  $I0 = 42       # positive
  $I1 = -1       # negative

Integer literals can also be binary, octal, or hexadecimal:

  $I3 = 0b01010  # binary
  $I3 = 0o78     # octal
  $I2 = 0xA5     # hexadecimal

Floating point number literals have a decimal point, and can use scientific
notation:

  $N0 = 3.14
  $N2 = -1.2e+4

X<strings;in PIR>
String literals are enclosed in single or double-quotes.N<L<Strings>
explains the differences between the quoting types.>

  $S0 = "This is a valid literal string"
  $S1 = 'This is also a valid literal string'

=head3 Variables

PIR variables can store four different kinds of valuesE<mdash>integers,
numbers (floating point), strings, and objects. Parrot's objects are
called PMCs, for "I<P>olyI<M>orphic I<C>ontainer".

The simplest kind of variable is a register variable. The name of a
register variable always starts with a dollar sign (C<$>), followed by a
single character which specifies the type of the registerE<mdash>integer
(C<I>), number (C<N>), string (C<S>), or PMC (C<P>)E<mdash>, and end
with a unique number. N<The number of a register variable usually does
not correspond to the register used internally; Parrot's compiler remaps
registers as appropriate.> Register variables don't have to be
predeclared:

  $S0 = "Who's a pretty boy, then?"
  say $S0

PIR also has named variables, which are declared with the C<.local>
directive.  As with register variables, there are four valid types for
named variables: C<int>, C<num>, C<string>, and C<pmc>.  Named variables
have to be declared, but otherwise behave exactly the same as register
variables.

  .local string hello
  hello "'Allo, 'allo, 'allo."
  say hello


X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);constants>
X<constants (PIR)>

The C<.const> directive declares a named constant. Named constants are similar to named variables, but their values are set in the declaration and can never be changed. Like C<.local>, C<.const> takes a type and a name. It also requires a literal argument to set the value of the constant.

  .const int    frog = 4                       # integer constant
  .const string name = "Superintendent Parrot" # string constant
  .const num    pi   = 3.14159                 # floating point constant

Named constants may be used in all the same places as literals,
but have to be declared beforehand. The following example declares a named string constant C<hello> and prints the value:

  .const string hello = "Hello, Polly."
  say hello


=head3 Control Flow

=head3 Subroutines

A PIR subroutine starts with the C<.sub> directive and ends with the C<.end> directive. Parameter declarations use the C<.param> directive, and look a lot like named variable declarations. The following example declares a subroutined named C<greeting>, that takes a single string parameter named C<hello>:

  .sub greeting
      .param string hello
      say hello
  .end

=head2 Working with Numbers

Integers and numbers use platform-dependent sizes and
limitationsN<There are a few exceptions to this; Parrot smooths out some of the
bumps and inconsistencies so that PIR code behaves the same way on all
supported platforms>. Parrot treats both I and N registers as
signed quantities internally for the purposes of arithmetic. Parrot's floating
point values and operations all comply with the IEEE 754 standard.





=head2 Working with Strings

Strings in double-quotes accept all sorts of escape sequences using
backslashes. Strings in single-quotes only allow escapes for nested
quotes:

  $S0 = "This string is \n on two lines"
  $S0 = 'This is a \n one-line string with a slash in it'

Parrot supports several escape sequences in double-quoted strings:

  \xhh        1..2 hex digits
  \ooo        1..3 oct digits
  \cX         Control char X
  \x{h..h}    1..8 hex digits
  \uhhhh      4 hex digits
  \Uhhhhhhhh  8 hex digits
  \a          An ASCII alarm character
  \b          An ASCII backspace character
  \t          A tab
  \n          A newline
  \v          A vertical tab
  \f
  \r
  \e
  \\          A backslash
  \"          A quote

If you need more flexibility in defining a string, use a X<heredoc string
literal>.  The C<E<lt>E<lt>> operator starts a heredoc.  The string terminator
immediately follows.  All text until the terminator is part of the heredoc.
The terminator must appear on its own line, must appear at the beginning of the
line, and may not have any trailing whitespace.

  $S2 = << "End_Token"

  This is a multi-line string literal. Notice that
  it doesn't use quotation marks.

  End_Token

Strings are buffers of variable-sized data. The most common use of string
registers and variables is to store textual data. String registers I<may> also be
buffers for binary or other non-textual data, though this is rareN<In general,
a custom PMC is more useful>.  Parrot strings are flexible and powerful, to
account for all the complexity of human-readable (and computer-representable)
textual data.

=head3 Encodings and Charsets

X<charset>
A modern string system must manage several character encodings and charsets in
order to make sense out of all the string data in the world.  Parrot does this.
Every string has an associated encoding and an associated character set.  The
default charset is 8-bit ASCII, which is simple to use and is almost
universally supported.

Double-quoted string constants can have an optional prefix specifying the the
string's encoding and charsetN<As you might suspect, single-quoted strings do
not support this.>. Parrot will maintain these values internally, and will
automatically convert strings when necessary to preserve the information.
String prefixes are specified as C<encoding:charset:> at the front of the
string. Here are some examples:

  $S0 = utf8:unicode:"Hello UTF8 Unicode World!"
  $S1 = utf16:unicode:"Hello UTF16 Unicode World!"
  $S2 = ascii:"This is 8-bit ASCII"
  $S3 = binary:"This is raw, unformatted binary data"

The C<binary:> charset treats the string as a buffer of raw unformatted binary
data. It isn't really a string per se, because binary data contains no readable
characters.  As mentioned earlier, this exists to support libraries which
manipulate binary data that doesn't easily fit into any other primitive data
type.

When Parrot combines two strings (such as through concatenation), they must
both use the same character set and encoding.  Parrot will automatically
upgrade one or both of the strings to use the next highest compatible format as
necessary. ASCII strings will automatically upgrade to UTF-8 strings if needed,
and UTF-8 will upgrade to UTF-16. All of these conversions happen inside
Parrot; you the programmer don't need to worry about the details.

=head2 Working with PMCs

Polymorphic Containers (PMCs) are the basis for complex data types and
object-oriented behavior in Parrot. In PIR, any variable that isn't a low-level integer, number, or string is a PMC. Parrot provides a set of

resemble classes and objects are in
object-oriented languages. They are 

PMCs act much like any integer, floating-point
number, or string register or variable, but you have to instantiate a
new PMC object into a type before you use it. The C<new> instruction creates
a new PMC of the specified type:

  $P0 = new 'String'
  $P0 = "That's a bollard and not a parrot."
  say $P0

This example creates a C<String> object, stores it in the PMC register variable C<$P0>,
assigns it the value "Hello, Polly.", and prints it:

  .local String hello    # or .local pmc hello
  hello = new 'String'
  hello = "Hello, Polly."
  say hello

PIR is a dynamic language; that dynamicism is evident in how Parrot handles PMC
values. Primitive registers like strings, numbers, and integers perform a
special action called X<autoboxing> when assigned to a PMC. Autoboxing is the
process of converting a primitive type to a PMC object.  PMC classes exist for
String, Number, and Integer; notice that the primitive types are in lower-case,
while the PMC classes are capitalized. If you want to box a value explicitly,
use the C<box> opcode:

  $P0 = new 'Integer'       # The boxed form of int
  $P0 = box 42
  $P1 = new 'Number'        # The boxed form of num
  $P1 = box 3.14
  $P2 = new 'String'        # The boxed form of string
  $P2 = "This is a string!"

The PMC classes C<Integer>, C<Number>, and C<String> are thin overlays on the
primitive types they represent. These PMC types have the benefit of the
X<PMC;VTABLE Interface> VTABLE interface. VTABLEs are a standard API that all
PMCs conform to for performing standard operations. These PMC types support
custom methods to perform various operations, may be passed to subroutines that
expect PMC arguments, and can be subclassed by a user-defined type.


PMCs are are polymorphic data items that
can be one of a large variety of predefined types. As we have seen briefly,
and as we will see in more depth later, PMCs have a standard interface called
the VTABLE interface. VTABLEs are a standard list of functions that all PMCs
implement N<or, PMCs can choose not to implement each interface explicitly and
instead let Parrot call the default implementations>.

VTABLEs are very strict: There are a fixed number with fixed names and
fixed argument lists. You can't just create any random VTABLE interface that
you want to create, you can only make use of the ones that Parrot supplies
and expects. To circumvent this limitation, PMCs may have METHODS in
addition to VTABLEs. METHODs are arbitrary code functions that can be
written in C, may have any name, and may implement any behavior.

=head2 VTABLE Interfaces

Internally, all operations on PMCs are performed by calling various VTABLE
interfaces.

=head3 Type Conversion

The C<=> operator is very powerful.  Its simplest form stores a value into one
of the Parrot registers. It can assign a string value to a C<string> register,
an integer value to an C<int> register, a floating point value into a C<number>
register, etc. However, the C<=> operator can assign I<any> type of value into
I<any> type of register; Parrot will handle the conversion for you
automatically:

  $I0 = 5     # Integer. 5
  $S0 = $I0   # Stringify. "5"
  $N0 = $S0   # Numify. 5.0
  $I0 = $N0   # Intify. 5

Notice that conversions between the numeric formats and strings only makes
sense when the value to convert is a number.

  $S0 = "parrot"
  $I0 = $S0        # 0

An earlier example showed a string literal assigned to a PMC register of type
C<String>. This works for all the primitive types and their autoboxed PMC
equivalents:

  $P0 = new 'Integer'
  $P0 = 5
  $S0 = $P0      # Stringify. "5"
  $N0 = $P0      # Numify. 5.0
  $I0 = $P0      # Unbox. $I0 = 5

  $P1 = new 'String'
  $P1 = "5 birds"
  $S1 = $P1      # Unbox. $S1 = "5 birds"
  $I1 = $P1      # Intify. 5
  $N1 = $P1      # Numify. 5.0

  $P2 = new 'Number'
  $P2 = 3.14
  $S2 = $P2      # Stringify. "3.14"
  $I2 = $P2      # Intify. 3
  $N2 = $P2      # Unbox. $N2 = 3.14

=head2 Control Flow

Z<CHP-3-SECT-5>

X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);control flow>
X<control flow;in PIR>

Control flow in PIR occurs entirely with conditional and unconditional branches
to labels. This may seem simplistic and primitive, but here PIR shows its roots
as a thin overlay on the assembly language of a virtual processor.  PIR does
not support high-level looping structures such as C<while> or C<for> loops. PIR
has some support for basic C<if> branching constructs, but does not support
more complicated C<if>/C<then>/C<else> branch structures.  

The control structures of high-level languages hew tightly to the semantics of
those languages; Parrot provides the minimal feature set necessary to implement
any semantic of an HLL without dictating how that HLL may implement its
features.  Language agnosticism is an important design goal in Parrot, and
creates a very flexible and powerful development environment for language
developers.

X<goto instruction (PIR)>
The most basic branching instruction is the unconditional branch, C<goto>:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main'
      goto L1
      say "never printed"

  L1:
      say "after branch"
      end
  .end

=end PIR

The first C<say> statement never runs because the C<goto> always skips over it
to the label C<L1>.

The conditional branches combine C<if> or C<unless> with C<goto>.

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main'
      $I0 = 42
      if $I0 goto L1
      say "never printed"
  L1:
      say "after branch"
      end
  .end

=end PIR

X<if (conditional);instruction (PIR)> X<unless (conditional);instruction (PIR)>
In this example, the C<goto> branches to the label C<L1> only if the value
stored in C<$I0> is true. The C<unless> statement is similar, but it branches
when the tested value is false.  You can use PMC and STRING registers with
C<if> and C<unless>.  The op will call the C<get_bool> vtable entry on any PMC
so used and will convert the STRING to a boolean value.  An undefined value, 0,
or an empty string are all false values. All other values are true.

The comparison operators (C<E<lt>>, C<E<lt>=>, C<==>, C<!=>, C<E<gt>>,
C<E<gt>=>) can combine with C<if ...  goto>. These branch when the
comparison is true:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main'
      $I0 = 42
      $I1 = 43
      if $I0 < $I1 goto L1
      say "never printed"
  L1:
      say "after branch"
      end
  .end

=end PIR

This example compares C<$I0> to C<$I1> and branches to the label C<L1> if
C<$I0> is less than C<$I1>. The C<if $I0 E<lt> $I1 goto L1> statement
translates directly to the C<lt> branch operation.

Chapter 11's "PIR Instructions" section summarizes the other comparison
operators.

X<loops;PIR>
X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);loop constructs>
PIR has no special loop constructs. A combination of conditional and
unconditional branches handle iteration:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main'
      $I0 = 1               # product
      $I1 = 5               # counter

  REDO:                     # start of loop
      $I0 = $I0 * $I1
      dec $I1
      if $I1 > 0 goto REDO  # end of loop

      say $I0
      end
  .end

=end PIR

X<do-while style loop;(PIR)>
This example calculates the factorial C<5!>. Each time through the loop it
multiplies C<$I0> by the current value of the counter C<$I1>, decrements the
counter, and branches to the start of the loop.  The loop ends when C<$I1>
counts down to 0. This is a I<do while>-style loop with the condition test at
the end, so the code always runs the first time through.

X<while-style loop (PIR)>
For a I<while>-style loop with the condition test at the start, use a
conditional branch with an unconditional branch:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main'
      $I0 = 1               # product
      $I1 = 5               # counter

  REDO:                     # start of loop
      if $I1 <= 0 goto LAST
      $I0 = $I0 * $I1
      dec $I1
      goto REDO
  LAST:                     # end of loop

      say $I0
      end
  .end

=end PIR

This example tests the counter C<$I1> at the start of the loop. At the
end of the loop, it unconditionally branches back to the start of the
loop and tests the condition again. The loop ends when the counter
C<$I1> reaches 0 and the C<if> branches to the C<LAST> label. If the
counter isn't a positive number before the loop, the loop never
executes.

You can build any high-level flow control construct from conditional and
unconditional branches; the lowest level of computer hardware works this way.
All modern programming languages use branching constructs to implement their
most complex flow control devices.


=head2 Macros

=for author

Needs supplementing; needs moving.

=end for

=head2 Subroutines

X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);subroutine> X<subroutine (PIR)>
Subroutines in PIR are roughly equivalent to the subroutines or methods of a
high-level language.  All code in a PIR source file must occur within a
subroutine.  The simplest syntax for a PIR subroutine starts with the C<.sub>
directive and ends with the C<.end> directiveN<The name C<main> is only a
convention.>:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main'
      say "Hello, Polly."
  .end

=end PIR

This example defines a subroutine named C<main> that prints a string C<"Hello,
Polly.">. Parrot will normally execute the first subroutine it encounters in
the first file it runs, but you can flag any subroutine as the first one to
execute with the C<:main> marker:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'first'
      say "Polly want a cracker?"
  .end

  .sub 'second' :main
      say "Hello, Polly."
  .end

=end PIR

This code prints out "Hello, Polly." but not "Polly want a cracker?".  Though
the C<first> function appears first in the source code, C<second> has the
C<:main> flag and gets called.  C<first> is never called.  Revising that
program produces different results:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'first' :main
      say "Polly want a cracker?"
  .end

  .sub 'second'
      say "Hello, Polly."
  .end

=end PIR

The output now is "Polly want a cracker?". Execution in PIR starts at the
C<:main> function and continues until that function ends.  To perform other
operations, you must call other functions explicitly.  Chapter 4 describes
subroutines and their uses.


X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);subroutines>
X<subroutines;in PIR>
The most basic building block of code reuse in PIR is the subroutine. A large
program may perform a calculation like "the factorial of a number" several
times.  Subroutines abstract this behavior into a single, named, stand-alone
unit. PIR is a subroutine-based language in that all code in PIR must exist in
a subroutine. Execution starts in the C<:main> subroutine, which itself can
call other subroutines.  Subroutines can fit together into more elaborate
chunks of code reusability such as methods and objects.

Parrot supports multiple high-level languages.  Each language uses a different
syntax for defining and calling subroutines. The goal of PIR is not to be a
high-level language in itself, but to provide the basic tools that other
languages can use to implement them. PIR's subroutine syntax may seem very
primitive for this reason.

=head3 Parrot Calling Conventions

Z<CHP-4-SECT-1>

X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);subroutines;Parrot calling conventions>
X<subroutines;Parrot calling conventions;in PIR>

The way that Parrot calls a subroutine -- passing arguments, altering control
flow, and returning results -- is the "Parrot Calling Conventions" (PCC).
Parrot generally hides the details of PCC from the programmer.  PIR has several
constructs to gloss over these details, and the average programmer will not
need to worry about them.  PCC uses the Continuation Passing Style
X<Continuation Passing Style (CPS)>X<CPS (Continuation Passing Style)> (CPS) to
pass control to subroutines and back again. Again, the details are irrelevant
for most uses, but the power is available to anyone who wants to take advantage
of it.

=head3 Subroutine Calls

X<PIR (Parrot intermediate representation);subroutine calls>
PIR's simplest subroutine call syntax looks much like a subroutine
call from a high-level language. This example calls the subroutine
C<fact> with two arguments and assigns the result to C<$I0>:

  $I0 = 'fact'(count, product)

This simple statement hides much complexity. It generates a subroutine PMC
object, creates a continuation PMC object to represent the control flow up to
this point, passes the arguments, looks up the subroutine by name (and by
signature, if necessary)), calls the subroutine, and assigns the results of the
call to the appropriate integer register. This is all in addition to the
computation the subroutine itself performs.

The single line subroutine call is incredibly convenient, but it isn't always
flexible enough. PIR also has a more verbose call syntax that is still more
convenient than manual calls. This example looks up the subroutine C<fact> out
in the global symbol table and calls it:

  find_global $P1, "fact"

  .begin_call
    .arg count
    .arg product
    .call $P1
    .result $I0
  .end_call

X<.arg directive>
X<.result directive>
The whole chunk of code from C<.begin_call> to C<.end_call> acts as a single
unit. The C<.arg> directive sets up and passes arguments to the call. The
C<.call> directive calls the subroutine and identifies the point at which to
return control flow after the subroutine has completed. The C<.result>
directive retrieves returned values from the call.

=head3 Subroutine Declarations

X<.param directive> In addition to syntax for subroutine calls, PIR provides
syntax for subroutine definitions: the C<.sub> and C<.end> directives shown in
earlier examples.  The C<.param> directive defines input parameters and creates
local named variables for them (similar to C<.local>):

  .param int c

X<.return directive>
The C<.return> directive allows the subroutine to return control flow
to the calling subroutine, and optionally returns result output values.

Here's a complete code example that implements the factorial algorithm.  The
subroutine C<fact> is a separate subroutine, assembled and processed after the
C<main> function.  Parrot resolves global symbols like the C<fact> label
between different units.

=begin PIR

  # factorial.pir
  .sub 'main' :main
     .local int count
     .local int product
     count   = 5
     product = 1

     $I0 = 'fact'(count, product)

     say $I0
     end
  .end

  .sub 'fact'
     .param int c
     .param int p

  loop:
     if c <= 1 goto fin
     p = c * p
     dec c
     branch loop
  fin:
     .return (p)
  .end

=end PIR

This example defines two local named variables, C<count> and C<product>, and
assigns them the values 1 and 5. It calls the C<fact> subroutine with both
variables as arguments.  The C<fact> subroutine uses C<.param> to retrieve
these parameters and C<.return> to return the result.  The final printed result
is 120.

As usual, execution of the program starts at the C<:main> subroutine.

=head3 Parameters and Arguments

=head4 Named Parameters

=for author

We have to get our terms straight here.  Which are "arguments" (passed in) and
which are "parameters" (processed from within).

=end for

X<positional arguments>
X<named arguments>
Parameters passed only by their order are I<positional arguments>. The only
differentiator between positional arguments is their positions in the function
call.  Putting positional arguments in a different order will produce different
effects, or may cause errors. Parrot also supports I<named parameters>. Instead
of passing parameters by their position in the string, parameters are passed by
name and can be in any order.  Here's an example:

=begin PIR

 .sub 'MySub'
    .param string yrs :named("age")
    .param string call :named("name")
    $S0 = "Hello " . call
    $S1 = "You are " . yrs
    $S1 = $S1 . " years old"
    say $S0
    say $S1
 .end

 .sub 'main' :main
    'MySub'("age" => 42, "name" => "Bob")
 .end

=end PIR

You can also pass these pairs in the opposite order:

=begin PIR

 .sub 'main' :main
    'MySub'("name" => "Bob", "age" => 42)    # Same!
 .end

=end PIR

Named arguments can be a big help because you don't have to worry about the
exact order of variables, especially as argument lists get very long.

=head4 Optional Parameters

X<optional arguments>
Some functions have arguments with appropriate default values, so that callers
don't always have to pass them.  Parrot provides a mechanism to identify
optional argument.  Parrot also provides a flag value to determine if the
caller has passed in an optional argument.

Optional parameters appear in PIR as if they're actually I<two> parameters:
the value and its flag:

  .param string name     :optional
  .param int    has_name :opt_flag

The C<:optional> flag specifies that the given parameter is optional.  The
C<:opt_flag> specifies an integer which parameter contains a boolean flag; this
flag is true if the value was passed, and false otherwise. To provide a default
value for an optional parameter, you can write:

    .param string name     :optional
    .param int    has_name :opt_flag

    if has_name goto we_have_a_name
    name = "Default value"
  we_have_a_name:

Optional parameters can be positional or named parameters. When using them with
positional parameters, they must appear at the end of the list of positional
parameters. Also, the C<:opt_flag> parameter must always appear directly after
the C<:optional> parameter.

  .sub 'Foo'
    .param int optvalue :optional
    .param int hasvalue :opt_flag
    .param pmc notoptional          # WRONG!
    ...

  .sub 'Bar'
     .param int hasvalue :opt_flag
     .param int optvalue :optional  # WRONG!
     ...

  .sub 'Baz'
    .param int optvalue :optional
    .param pmc notoptional
    .param int hasvalue :opt_flag   # WRONG!
    ...

You may mix optional parameters with named parameters:

  .sub 'MySub'
    .param int value     :named("answer") :optional
    .param int has_value :opt_flag
    ...

You can call this function in two ways:

  'MySub'("answer" => 42)  # with a value
  'MySub'()                # without

=head4 Commandline Arguments

Programs written in Parrot have access to arguments passed on the command
line:

  .sub 'MyMain' :main
    .param pmc all_args :slurpy
    ...
  .end

=for author

Please verify and expand.

=end for

The C<all_args> PMC is a ResizableStringArray PMC, which means you can loop
over the results, access them individually, or even modify them.

=head3 Continuations

X<continuations>

Continuations are a kind of subroutine that take a snapshots of control flow. They are frozen images of the current
execution state of the VM. Once you have a continuation, you can invoke it to
return to the point where the continuation was first created. It's like a
magical timewarp that allows the developer to arbitrarily move control flow
back to any previous point in the program.

Continuations are like any other PMC; you can create one with the C<new> opcode:

  $P0 = new 'Continuation'

The new continuation starts off in an undefined state. If you attempt to invoke
a new continuation without initializing it, Parrot will throw an exception.  To
prepare the continuation for use, assign it a destination label with the
C<set_addr> opcode:

    $P0 = new 'Continuation'
    set_addr $P0, my_label

  my_label:
    ...

To jump to the continuation's stored label and return the context to the state
it was in I<at the point of its creation>, invoke the continuation:

  invoke $P0  # Explicit using "invoke" opcode
  $P0()       # Same, but nicer syntax

Even though you can use the subroutine notation C<$P0()> to invoke the
continuation, it doesn't make any sense to pass arguments or obtain return
values:

  $P0 = new 'Continuation'
  set_addr $P0, my_label

  $P0(1, 2)      # WRONG!

  $P1 = $P0()    # WRONG!



=head4 Continuation Passing Style

X<continuation passing style>
X<CPS>

Parrot uses continuations internally for control flow. When Parrot invokes a function, it creates a continuation representing the
current point in the program.  It passes this continuation as an invisible
parameter to the function call.  When that function returns, it invokes the
continuation -- in effect, it performs a goto to the point of creation of that
continuation.  If you have a continuation, you can invoke it to return to its
point of creation any time you want.

This type of flow control -- invoking continuations instead of performing bare
jumps -- is X<Continuation Passing Style;CPS> Continuation Passing Style (CPS).



=head4 Tailcalls

In many cases, a subroutine will set up and call another subroutine, and then
return the result of the second call directly. This is a X<tailcall> tailcall,
and is an important opportunity for optimization.  Here's a contrived example
in pseudocode:

  call add_two(5)

  subroutine add_two(value)
    value = add_one(value)
    return add_one(value)

In this example, the subroutine C<add_two> makes two calls to c<add_one>. The
second call to C<add_one> is the return value. C<add_one> gets called; its
result gets returned to the caller of C<add_two>.  Nothing in C<add_two> uses
that return value directly.

A simple optimization is available for this type of code.  The second call to
C<add_one> can return to the same place that C<add_two> returns; therefore,
it's perfectly safe and correct to use the same return continuation that
C<add_two> uses. The two subroutine calls can share a return continuation,
instead of having to create a new continuation for each call.

X<.tailcall directive>

PIR provides the C<.tailcall> directive to identify similar situations.  Use it
in place of the C<.return> directive. C<.tailcall> performs this optimization
by reusing the return continuation of the parent function to make the tailcall:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main' :main
      .local int value
      value = add_two(5)
      say value
  .end

  .sub 'add_two'
      .param int value
      .local int val2
      val2 = add_one(value)
      .tailcall add_one(val2)
  .end

  .sub 'add_one'
      .param int a
      .local int b
      b = a + 1
      .return (b)
  .end

=end PIR

This example above will print out the correct value "7".




=head3 Coroutines

X<PIR;Coroutines>
X<Coroutines>
We've mentioned coroutines several times before, and we're finally going
to explain what they are. Coroutines are similar to subroutines except
that they have an internal notion of I<state> N<And the cool new name!>.
Coroutines, in addition to performing a normal C<.return> to return
control flow back to the caller and destroy the lexical environment of
the subroutine, may also perform a C<.yield> operation. C<.yield> returns
a value to the caller like C<.return> can, but it does not destroy the
lexical state of the coroutine. The next time the coroutine is called, it
continues execution from the point of the last C<.yield>, not at the
beginning of the coroutine.

In a Coroutine, when we continue from a C<.yield>, the entire lexical
environment is the same as it was when C<.yield> was called. This
means that the parameter values don't change, even if we call the
coroutine with different arguments later.

Coroutines are defined like any ordinary subroutine. They do not require
any special flag or any special syntax to mark them as being a
coroutine. However, what sets them apart is the use of the C<.yield>
directive. C<.yield> plays several roles:

=over 4

=item * Identifies coroutines

When Parrot sees a yield, it knows to create a Coroutine PMC object
instead of a Sub PMC.

=item * Creates a continuation

Continuations, as we have already seen, allow us to continue
execution at the point of the continuation later. It's like a snapshot of
the current execution environment. C<.yield> creates a continuation in
the coroutine and stores the continuation object in the coroutine object
or later resuming from the point of the C<.yield>.

=item * Returns a value

C<.yield> can return a value N<or many values, or no values> to the caller.
It is basically the same as a C<.return> in this regard.

=back

Here is a quick example of a simple coroutine:

  .sub 'MyCoro'
    .yield(1)
    .yield(2)
    .yield(3)
    .return(4)
  .end

  .sub 'main' :main
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 1
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 2
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 3
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 4
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 1
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 2
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 3
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 4
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 1
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 2
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 3
    $I0 = MyCoro()    # 4
  .end

This is obviously a contrived example, but it demonstrates how the coroutine
stores it's state. The coroutine stores it's state when we reach a C<.yield>
directive, and when the coroutine is called again it picks up where it last
left off. Coroutines also handle parameters in a way that might not be
intuitive. Here's an example of this:

  .sub 'StoredConstant'
    .param int x
    .yield(x)
    .yield(x)
    .yield(x)
  .end

  .sub 'main' :main
    $I0 = StoredConstant(5)       # $I0 = 5
    $I0 = StoredConstant(6)       # $I0 = 5
    $I0 = StoredConstant(7)       # $I0 = 5
    $I0 = StoredConstant(8)       # $I0 = 8
  .end

Notice how even though we are calling the C<StoredConstant> coroutine with
different arguments each time, the value of parameter C<x> doesn't change
until the coroutine's state resets after the last C<.yield>. Remember that
a continuation takes a snapshot of the current state, and the C<.yield>
directive takes a continuation. The next time we call the coroutine, it
invokes the continuation internally, and returns us to the exact same place in
the exact same condition as we were when we called the C<.yield>. In order
to reset the coroutine and enable it to take a new parameter, we must either
execute a C<.return> directive or reach the end of the coroutine.

=head3 Multiple Dispatch

Multiple dispatch is when there are multiple subroutines in a single
namespace with the same name. These functions must differ, however, in
their parameter list, or "signature". All subs with the same name get
put into a single PMC called a MultiSub. The MultiSub is like a list
of subroutines. When the multisub is invoked, the MultiSub PMC object
searches through the list of subroutines and searches for the one with
the closest matching signature. The best match is the sub that gets
invoked.

MultiSubs are subroutines with the C<:multi> flag applied to them.
MultiSubs (also called "Multis") must all differ from one another in
the number and/or type of arguments passed to the function. Having
two multisubs with the same function signature could result in a
parsing error, or the later function could overwrite the former one
in the multi.

Multisubs are defined like this:

  .sub 'MyMulti' :multi
      # does whatever a MyMulti does
  .end

Multis belong to a specific namespace. Functions in different namespaces
with the same name do not conflict with each other N<this is one of the
reasons for having multisubs in the first place!>. It's only when
multiple functions in a single namespace need to have the same name that
a multi is used.

Multisubs take a special designator called a I<multi signature>. The multi
signature tells Parrot what particular combination of input parameters the
multi accepts. Each multi will have a different signature, and Parrot will
be able to dispatch to each one depending on the arguments passed. The
multi signature is specified in the C<:multi> directive:

  .sub 'Add' :multi(I, I)
    .param int x
    .param int y
    .return(x + y)
  .end

  .sub 'Add' :multi(N, N)
    .param num x
    .param num y
    .return(x + y)
  .end

  .sub 'Start' :main
    $I0 = Add(1, 2)      # 3
    $N0 = Add(3.14, 2.0) # 5.14
    $S0 = Add("a", "b")  # ERROR! No (S, S) variant!
  .end

Multis can take I, N, S, and P types, but they can also use C<_> (underscore)
to denote a wildcard, and a string that can be the name of a particular PMC
type:

  .sub 'Add' :multi(I, I)  # Two integers
    ...

  .sub 'Add' :multi(I, 'Float')  # An integer and Float PMC
    ...

                           # Two Integer PMCs
  .sub 'Add' :multi('Integer', _)
    ...

When we call a multi PMC, Parrot will try to take the most specific
best-match variant, and will fall back to more general variants if a perfect
best-match cannot be found. So if we call C<'Add'(1, 2)>, Parrot will dispatch
to the C<(I, I)> variant. If we call C<'Add'(1, "hi")>, Parrot will match the
C<(I, _)> variant, since the string in the second argument doesn't match C<I>
or C<'Float'>. Parrot can also choose to automatically promote one of the I,
N, or S values to an Integer, Float, or String PMC.

To make the decision about which multi variant to call, Parrot takes a
I<Manhattan Distance> between the two. Parrot calculates the I<distance>
between the multi signatures and the argument signature. Every difference
counts as one step. A difference can be an autobox from a primitive type
to a PMC, or the conversion from one primitive type to another, or the
matching of an argument to a C<_> wildcard. After Parrot calculates the
distance to each variant, it calls the function with the lowest distance.
Notice that it's possible to define a variant that is impossible to call:
for every potential combination of arguments there is a better match. This
isn't necessarily a common occurrence, but it's something to watch out for
in systems with a lot of multis and a limited number of data types in use.

=head3 Sub PMCs

Subroutines are a PMC type in Parrot. You can store them in PMC registers and
manipulate them just as you do the other PMC types.  Look up a subroutine in
the current namespace with the C<get_global> opcode:

  $P0 = get_global "MySubName"

To find a subroutine in a different namespace, first look up the appropriate
the namespace PMC, then use that with C<get_global>:

  $P0 = get_namespace "MyNamespace"
  $P1 = get_global $P0, "MySubName"

You can obviously invoke a Sub PMC:

  $P0(1, 2, 3)

You can get or even I<change> its name:

  $S0 = $P0               # Get the current name
  $P0 = "MyNewSubName"    # Set a new name

You can get a hash of the complete metadata for the subroutine:

  $P1 = inspect $P0

The metadata fields in this hash are

=over 4

=item * pos_required

The number of required positional parameters to the Sub

=item * pos_optional

The number of optional positional parameters to the Sub

=item * named_required

The number of required named parameters to the Sub

=item * named_optional

The number of optional named parameters to the Sub

=item * pos_slurpy

Returns true if the sub has a slurpy parameter to eat up extra positional args

=item * named_slurpy

Returns true if the sub has a slurpy parameter to eat up extra named args

=back

Instead of getting the whole inspection hash, you ask about individual pieces
of metadata:

  $I0 = inspect $P0, "pos_required"

To discover to get the total number of defined parameters to the Sub, call the
C<arity> method:

  $I0 = $P0.'arity'()

To fetch the namespace PMC that the Sub was defined into, call the
C<get_namespace> method:

  $P1 = $P0.'get_namespace'()





=head2 Lexical Variables

As we have seen above, we can declare a new subroutine to be a nested inner
subroutine of an existing outer subroutine using the C<:outer> flag. The
outer flag is used to specify the name of the outer subroutine. Where there
may be multiple subroutines with the same name N<such is the case with
multisubs, which we will discuss soon>, we can use the C<:subid> flag on the
outer subroutine to give it a different--and unique--name that the lexical
subroutines can reference in their C<:outer> declarations. Within lexical
subroutines, the C<.lex> command defines a local variable that follows these
scoping rules.

=head3 LexPad and LexInfo PMCs

Information about lexical variables in a subroutine is stored in two different
types of PMCs: The LexPad PMC that we already mentioned briefly, and the
LexInfo PMCs which we haven't. Neither of these PMC types are really usable
from PIR code, but are instead used by Parrot internally to store information
about lexical variables.

C<LexInfo> PMCs are used to store information about lexical variables at
compile time. This is read-only information that is generated during
compilation to represent what is known about lexical variables. Not all
subroutines get a LexInfo PMC by default, you need to indicate to Parrot
somehow that you require a LexInfo PMC to be created. One way to do this is
with the C<.lex> directive that we looked at above. Of course, the C<.lex>
directive only works for languages where the names of lexical variables are
all known at compile time. For languages where this information isn't known,
the subroutine can be flagged with C<:lex> instead.

C<LexPad> PMCs are used to store run-time information about lexical variables.
This includes their current values and their type information. LexPad PMCs are
created at runtime for subs that have a C<LexInfo> PMC already. These are
created each time the subroutine is invoked, which allows for recursive
subroutine calls without overwriting variable names.

With a Subroutine PMC, you can get access to the associated LexInfo PMC by
calling the C<'get_lexinfo'> method:

  $P0 = find_global "MySubroutine"
  $P1 = $P0.'get_lexinfo'()

Once you have the LexInfo PMC, there are a limited number of operations that
you can call with it:

  $I0 = elements $P1    # Get the number of lexical variables from it
  $P0 = $P1["name"]     # Get the entry for lexical variable "name"

There really isn't much else useful to do with LexInfo PMCs, they're mostly
used by Parrot internally and aren't helpful to the PIR programmer.

There is no easy way to get a reference to the current LexPad PMC in a given
subroutine, but like LexInfo PMCs that doesn't matter because they aren't
useful from PIR anyway. Remember that subroutines themselves can be lexical
and that therefore the lexical environment of a given variable can extend to
multiple subroutines and therefore multiple LexPads. The opcodes C<find_lex>
and C<store_lex> automatically search through nested LexPads recursively to
find the proper environment information about the given variables.

=head3 Lexical Subroutines

X<Lexical Subroutines>

Parrot offers support for lexical subroutines.  You can define a subroutine by
name inside a larger subroutine, where the inner subroutine is only visible and
callable from the outer. The inner subroutine inherits all the lexical
variables from the outer subroutine, but can itself define its own lexical
variables that the outer subroutine cannot access.   PIR lacks the concept of
blocks or nested lexical scopes; this is how it performs the same function.

If the subroutine is lexical, you can get its C<:outer> with the C<get_outer>
method on the Sub PMC:

  $P1 = $P0.'get_outer'()

If there is no C<:outer> PMC, this returns a NULL PMC. Conversely, you can
set the outer sub:

  $P0.'set_outer'($P1)

=head3 Scope and HLLs

As mentioned previously, X<High Level Languages;HLL> High Level Languages such
as Perl, Python, and Ruby allow nested scopes, or blocks within blocks that can
have their own lexical variables.  Even this construct is common in the C
programming language:

  {
      int x = 0;
      int y = 1;
      {
          int z = 2;
          /* x, y, and z are all visible here */
      }

      /* only x and y are visible here */
  }

In the inner block, all three varaibles are visible.  The variable C<z> is only
visible inside that block. The outer block has no knowledge of C<z>.  A very
direct, naI<iuml>ve translation of this code to PIR might be:

  .param int x
  .param int y
  .param int z
  x = 0
  y = 1
  z = 2
  ...

This PIR code is similar, but the handling of the variable C<z> is different:
C<z> is visible throughout the entire current subroutine, where it is not
visible throughout the entire C function. To help approximate this effect, PIR
supplies lexical subroutines to create nested lexical scopes.

=head3 PIR Scoping

Only one PIR structure supports scoping like this: the subroutineN<... and
objects that inherit from subroutines, such as methods, coroutines, and
multisubs>. There are no blocks in PIR that have their own scope besides
subroutines. Fortunately, we can use these lexical subroutines to simulate this
behavior that HLLs require:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'MyOuter'
      .local int x,y
      .lex 'x', x
      .lex 'y', y
      'MyInner'()
      # only x and y are visible here
  .end

  .sub 'MyInner' :outer('MyOuter')
      .local int z
      .lex 'z', z
      #x, y, and z are all "visible" here
  .end

=end PIR

In the example above we put the word C<"visible"> in quotes. This is because
lexically-defined variables need to be accessed with the C<get_lex> and
C<set_lex> opcodes. These two opcodes don't just access the value of a
register, where the value is stored while it's being used, but they also make
sure to interact with the C<LexPad> PMC that's storing the data. If the value
isn't properly stored in the LexPad, then they won't be available in nested
inner subroutines, or available from C<:outer> subroutines either.

=head2 Namespaces

X<Namespaces>
X<.namespace>
Namespaces provide a mechanism where names can be reused. This may not
sound like much, but in large complicated systems, or systems with
many included libraries, it can be very handy. Each namespace gets its
own area for function names and global variables. This way you can have
multiple functions named C<create> or C<new> or C<convert>, for
instance, without having to use I<Multi-Method Dispatch> (MMD) which we
will describe later. Namespaces are also vital for defining classes and their
methods, which we already mentioned. We'll talk about all those uses here.

Namespaces are specified with the C<.namespace []> directive. The brackets
are not optional, but the keys inside them are. Here are some examples:

  .namespace [ ]               # The root namespace
  .namespace [ "Foo" ]         # The namespace "Foo"
  .namespace [ "Foo" ; "Bar" ] # Namespace Foo::Bar
  .namespace                   # WRONG! The [] are needed

Using semicolons, namespaces can be nested to any arbitrary depth.
Namespaces are special types of PMC, so we can access them and manipulate
them just like other data objects. We can get the PMC for the root
namespace using the C<get_root_namespace> opcode:

  $P0 = get_root_namespace

The current namespace, which might be different from the root namespace
can be retrieved with the C<get_namespace> opcode:

  $P0 = get_namespace             # get current namespace PMC
  $P0 = get_namespace ["Foo"]     # get PMC for namespace "Foo"

Namespaces are arranged into a large n-ary tree. There is the root namespace
at the top of the tree, and in the root namespace are various special HLL
namespaces. Each HLL compiler gets its own HLL namespace where it can store
its data during compilation and runtime. Each HLL namespace may have a large
hierarchy of other namespaces. We'll talk more about HLL namespaces and their
significance in chapter 10.

The root namespace is a busy place. Everybody could be lazy and use it to store
all their subroutines and global variables, and then we would run into all
sorts of collisions. One library would define a function "Foo", and then
another library could try to create another subroutine with the same name.
This is called I<namespace pollution>, because everybody is trying to put
things into the root namespace, and those things are all unrelated to each
other. Best practices requires that namespaces be used to hold private
information away from public information, and to keep like things together.

As an example, the namespace C<Integers> could be used to store subroutines
that deal with integers. The namespace C<images> could be used to store
subroutines that deal with creating and manipulating images. That way, when
we have a subroutine that adds two numbers together, and a subroutine that
performs additive image composition, we can name them both C<add> without any
conflict or confusion. And within the C<image> namespace we could have sub
namespaces for C<jpeg> and C<MRI> and C<schematics>, and each of these could
have a C<add> method without getting into each other's way.

The short version is this: use namespaces. There aren't any penalties to them,
and they do a lot of work to keep things organized and separated.

=head3 Namespace PMC

The C<.namespace> directive that we've seen sets the current namespace. In
PIR code, we have multiple ways to address a namespace:

  # Get namespace "a/b/c" starting at the root namespace
  $P0 = get_root_namespace ["a" ; "b" ; "c"]

  # Get namespace "a/b/c" starting in the current HLL namespace.
  $P0 = get_hll_namespace ["a" ; "b" ; "c"]
  # Same
  $P0 = get_root_namespace ["hll" ; "a" ; "b" ; "c"]

  # Get namespace "a/b/c" starting in the current namespace
  $P0 = get_namespace ["a" ; "b" ; "c"]

Once we have a namespace PMC we can retrieve global variables and
subroutine PMCs from it using the following functions:

  $P1 = get_global $S0            # Get global in current namespace
  $P1 = get_global ["Foo"], $S0   # Get global in namespace "Foo"
  $P1 = get_global $P0, $S0       # Get global in $P0 namespace PMC

=head3 Operations on the Namespace PMC

We've seen above how to find a Namespace PMC. Once you have it, there are a
few things you can do with it. You can find methods and variables that are
stored in the namespace, or you can add new ones:

  $P0 = get_namespace
  $P0.'add_namespace'($P1)      # Add Namespace $P1 to $P0
  $P1 = $P0.'find_namespace'("MyOtherNamespace")

  # Find namespace "MyNamespace" in $P0, create it if it
  #    doesn't exist
  $P1 = $P0.'make_namespace'("MyNamespace")

  $P0.'add_sub'("MySub", $P2)   # Add Sub PMC $P2 to the namespace
  $P1 = $P0.'find_sub'("MySub") # Find it

  $P0.'add_var'("MyVar", $P3)   # Add variable "MyVar" in $P3
  $P1 = $P0.'find_var'("MyVar") # Find it

  # Return the name of Namespace $P0 as a ResizableStringArray
  $P3 = $P0.'get_name'()

  # Find the parent namespace that contains this one:
  $P5 = $P0.'get_parent'()

  # Get the Class PMC associated with this namespace:
  $P6 = $P0.'get_class'()

There are a few other operations that can be done on Namespaces, but none
as interesting as these. We'll talk about Namespaces throughout the rest
of this chapter.


=head2 Classes and Objects

It may seem more appropriate for a discussion of PIR's support for classes
and objects to reside in its own chapter, instead of appearing in a generic
chapter about PIR programming "basics". However, part of PIR's core
functionality is its support for object-oriented programming. PIR doesn't
use all the fancy syntax as other OO languages, and it doesn't even support
all the features that most modern OO languages have. What PIR does have is
support for some of the basic structures and abilities, the necessary subset
to construct richer and higher-level object systems.


=head3 Attributes

Classes and subclasses can be given attributes N<in addition to methods,
which we will talk about in the next chapter> which are named data fields.
Attributes are created with the C<addattribute> opcode, and can be set
and retrieved with the C<setattribute> and C<getattribute> opcodes
respectively:

  # Create the new class with two attributes
  $P0 = newclass 'MyClass'
  addattribute $P0, 'First'
  addattribute $P0, 'Second'

  # Create a new item of type MyClass
  $P1 = new 'MyClass'

  # Set values to the attributes
  setattribute $P1, 'First', 'First Value'
  setattribute $P1, 'Second', 'Second Value'

  # Get the attribute values
  $S0 = getattribute $P1, 'First'
  $S1 = getattribute $P1, 'Second'

Those values added as attributes don't need to be strings, even though
both of the ones in the example are. They can be integers, numbers
or PMCs too.

=head3 Methods

PIR provides syntax to simplify writing methods and method calls for
object-oriented programming. We've seen some method calls in the examples
above, especially when we were talking about the interfaces to certain PMC
types. We've also seen a little bit of information about classes and objects
in the previous chapter. PIR allows you to define your own classes, and with
those classes you can define method interfaces to them. Method calls follow
the same Parrot calling conventions that we have seen above, including all the
various parameter configurations, lexical scoping, and other aspects we have
already talked about.

The second type of class can be defined in PIR at runtime. We saw some
examples of this in the last chapter using the C<newclass> and C<subclass>
opcodes. We also talked about class attribute values. Now, we're going to talk
about associating subroutines with these classes, and they're called
I<methods>. Methods are just like other normal subroutines with two major
changes: they are marked with the C<:method> flag, and they exist in a
I<namespace>. Before we can talk about methods, we need to discuss
namespaces first.

Z<CHP-4-SECT-2.2>

Methods are just like subroutines, except
they are invoked on a object PMC, and that PMC is passed as the c<self>
parameter.

The basic syntax for a method call is similar to the single line
subroutine call above. It takes a variable for the invocant PMC and a
string with the name of the method:

  object."methodname"(arguments)

Notice that the name of the method must be contained in quotes. If the
name of the method is not contained in quotes, it's treated as a named
variable that does. Here's an example:

  .local string methname = "Foo"
  object.methname()               # Same as object."Foo"()
  object."Foo"()                  # Same

The invocant can be a variable or register, and the method name can be
a literal string, string variable, or method object PMC.

=head3 Defining Methods

Methods are defined like any other subroutine except with two major
differences: They must be inside a namespace named after the class
they are a part of, and they must use the C<:method> flag.

  .namespace [ "MyClass"]

  .sub "MyMethod" :method
    ...

Inside the method, the invocant object can be accessed using the C<self>
keyword. C<self> isn't the only name you can call this value, however.
You can also use the C<:invocant> flag to define a new name for the invocant
object:

(See TT #483)

=begin PIR

  .sub "MyMethod" :method
    $S0 = self                    # Already defined as "self"
    say $S0
  .end

  .sub "MyMethod2" :method
    .param pmc item :invocant     # "self" is now called "item"
    $S0 = item
    say $S0
  .end

=end PIR

This example defines two methods in the C<Foo> class. It calls one
from the main body of the subroutine and the other from within the
first method:

=begin PIR

  .sub main
    .local pmc class
    .local pmc obj
    newclass class, "Foo"       # create a new Foo class
    new obj, "Foo"              # instantiate a Foo object
    obj."meth"()                # call obj."meth" which is actually
    print "done\n"              # in the "Foo" namespace
    end
  .end

  .namespace [ "Foo" ]          # start namespace "Foo"

  .sub meth :method             # define Foo::meth global
     print "in meth\n"
     $S0 = "other_meth"         # method names can be in a register too
     self.$S0()                 # self is the invocant
  .end

  .sub other_meth :method       # define another method
     print "in other_meth\n"    # as above Parrot provides a return
  .end                          # statement

=end PIR

Each method call looks up the method name in the object's class namespace.
The C<.sub> directive automatically makes a symbol table entry for the
subroutine in the current namespace.

When a C<.sub> is declared as a C<:method>, it automatically creates a
local variable named C<self> and assigns it the object passed in
C<P2>. You don't need to write C<.param pmc self> to get it, it comes
free with the method.

You can pass multiple arguments to a method and retrieve multiple
return values just like a single line subroutine call:

  (res1, res2) = obj."method"(arg1, arg2)


=head3 Introspection

The details about various PMC classes are managed by the Class PMC. Class PMCs
contain information about the class, available methods, the inheritance
hierarchy of the class, and various other details. Classes can be created
with the C<newclass> opcode:

  $P0 = newclass "MyClass"

Once we have created the class PMC, we can instantiate objects of that class
using the C<new> opcode. The C<new> opcode takes either the class name or the
Class PMC as an argument:

  $P1 = new $P0        # $P0 is the Class PMC
  $P2 = new "MyClass"  # Same

The C<new> opcode can create two different types of PMC. The first type are
the built-in core PMC classes. The built-in PMCs are written in C and cannot
be extended from PIR without subclassing. However, you can also create
user-defined PMC types in PIR. User-defined PMCs use the Object PMC type for
instantiation. Object PMCs are used for all user-defined type and keep track
of the methods and VTABLE override definitions. We're going to talk about
methods and VTABLE overrides in the next chapter.

=head2 Subclassing PMCs

Existing built-in PMC types can be subclassed to associate additional data
and methods with that PMC type. Subclassed PMC types act like their PMC
base types, by sharing the same VTABLE methods and underlying data types.
However, the subclass can define additional methods and attribute data
storage. If necessary new VTABLE interfaces can be defined in PIR and old
VTABLE methods can be overridden using PIR. We'll talk about defining
methods and VTABLE interface overrides in the next chapter.

Creating a new subclass of an existing PMC class is done using the
C<subclass> keyword:

  # create an anonymous subclass
  $P0 = subclass 'ResizablePMCArray'

  # create a subclass named "MyArray"
  $P0 = subclass 'ResizablePMCArray', 'MyArray'

This returns a C<Class> PMC which can be used to create and modify the
class by adding attributes or creating objects of that class. You can also
use the new class PMC to create additional subclasses:

  $P0 = subclass 'ResizablePMCArray', 'MyArray'
  $P1 = subclass $P0, 'MyOtherArray'

Once you have created these classes, you can create them like normal with
the C<new> keyword:

  $P0 = new 'MyArray'
  $P1 = new 'MyOtherArray'



=head3 Vtable Overrides

PMCs all subscribe to a common interface of functions called X<VTABLE>
VTABLEs. Every PMC implements the same set of these interfaces, which
perform very specific low-level tasks on the PMC. The term VTABLE was
originally a shortened form of the name "virtual function table",
although that name isn't used any more by the developers, or in any of
the documentation. The virtual functions in the VTABLE, called X<VTABLE
interfaces> VTABLE interfaces, are similar to ordinary functions and
methods in many respects. VTABLE interfaces are occasionally called
"VTABLE functions", or "VTABLE methods" or even "VTABLE entries" in
casual conversation. A quick comparison shows that VTABLE interfaces
are not really subroutines or methods in the way that those terms have
been used throughout the rest of Parrot. Like methods on an object,
VTABLE interfaces are defined for a specific class of PMC, and can be
invoked on any member of that class. Likewise, in a VTABLE interface
declaration, the C<self> keyword is used to describe the object that
it is invoked upon. That's where the similarities end, however. Unlike
ordinary subroutines or methods, VTABLE methods cannot be invoked
directly, they are also not inherited through class hierarchies like
how methods are. With all this terminology discussion out of the way,
we can start talking about what VTABLES are and how they are used in
Parrot.

VTABLE interfaces are the primary way that data in the PMC is accessed
and modified. VTABLES also provide a way to invoke the PMC if it's a
subroutine or subroutine-like PMC. VTABLE interfaces are not called
directly from PIR code, but are instead called internally by Parrot to
implement specific opcodes and behaviors. For instance, the C<invoke>
opcode calls the C<invoke> VTABLE interface of the subroutine PMC,
while the C<inc> opcode on a PMC calls the C<increment> VTABLE
interface on that PMC. What VTABLE interface overrides do, in essence,
is to allow the programmer to change the very way that Parrot accesses
PMC data in the most fundamental way, and changes the very way that the
opcodes act on that data.

PMCs, as we will look at more closely in later chapters, are typically
implemented using X<PMC Script> PMC Script, a layer of syntax and macros
over ordinary C code. A X<PMC Compiler> PMC compiler program converts the
PMC files into C code for compilation as part of the ordinary build
process. However, VTABLE interfaces can be written I<and overwritten> in
PIR using the C<:vtable> flag on a subroutine declaration. This technique
is used most commonly when subclassing an existing PMC class in PIR code
to create a new data type with custom access methods.

VTABLE interfaces are declared with the C<:vtable> flag:

  .sub 'set_integer' :vtable
      #set the integer value of the PMC here
  .end

in which case the subroutine must have the same name as the VTABLE
interface it is intended to implement. VTABLE interfaces all have very
specific names, and you can't override one with just any arbitrary name.
However, if you would like to name the function something different but
still use it as a VTABLE interface, you could add an additional name
parameter to the flag:

  .sub 'MySetInteger' :vtable('set_integer')
      #set the integer value of the PMC here
  .end

VTABLE interfaces are often given the C<:method> flag also, so that they can
be used directly in PIR code as methods, in addition to being used by Parrot
as VTABLE interfaces. This means we can have the following:

  .namespace [ "MyClass" ]

  .sub 'ToString' :vtable('get_string') :method
      $S0 = "hello!"
      .return($S0)
  .end

  .namespace [ "OtherClass" ]

  .local pmc myclass = new "MyClass"
  say myclass                 # say converts to string internally
  $S0 = myclass               # Convert to a string, store in $S0
  $S0 = myclass.'ToString'()  # The same

Inside a VTABLE interface definition, the C<self> local variable contains
the PMC on which the VTABLE interface is invoked, just like in a method
declaration.


=head3 Roles

As we've seen above and in the previous chapter, Class PMCs and NameSpace
PMCs work to keep classes and methods together in a logical way. There is
another factor to add to this mix: The Role PMC.

Roles are like classes, but don't stand on their own. They represent
collections of methods and VTABLES that can be added into an existing class.
Adding a role to a class is called I<composing> that role, and any class
that has been composed with a role C<does> that role.

Roles are created as PMC and can be manipulated through opcodes and methods
like other PMCs:

  $P0 = new 'Role'
  $P1 = get_global "MyRoleSub"
  $P0.'add_method'("MyRoleSub", $P1)

Once we've created a role and added methods to it, we can add that role to
a class, or even to another role:

  $P1 = new 'Role'
  $P2 = new 'Class'
  $P1.'add_role'($P0)
  $P2.'add_role'($P0)
  add_role $P2, $P0    # Same!

Now that we have added the role, we can check whether we implement it:

  $I0 = does $P2, $P0  # Yes

We can get a list of roles from our Class PMC:

  $P3 = $P2.'roles'()

Roles are very useful for ensuring that related classes all implement a common
interface.  


=head2 Filehandles

Like almost everything else in Parrot, input and output are handled by PMCs.

We've seen C<print> and C<say>. C<print> prints
the given string argument, or the stringified form of the argument, if it's
not a string, to standard output. C<say> does the same thing but also appends
a trailing newline to it. Another opcode worth mentioning is the C<printerr>
opcode, which prints an argument to the standard error output instead.

We can read values from the standard input using the C<read> and C<readline>
ops. C<read> takes an integer value and returns a string with that many
characters. C<readline> reads an entire line of input from the standard
input, and returns the string without the trailing newline. Here is a simple
echo program that reads in characters from the user and echos them to
standard output:

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main'
    loop_top:
      $S0 = read 10
      print $S0
      goto loop_top
  .end

=end PIR

The ops we have seen so far are useful if all your I/O operations are limited
to the standard streams. However, there are plenty of other places where
you might want to get data from and send data to. Things like files, sockets,
and databases all might need to have data sent to them. These things can be
done by using a file handle.

Filehandles are PMCs that describe a file and keep track of an I/O operations
internal state. We can get Filehandles for the standard streams using dedicated
opcodes:

  $P0 = getstdin    # Standard input handle
  $P1 = getstdout   # Standard output handle
  $P2 = getstderr   # Standard error handle

If we have a file, we can create a handle to it using the C<open> op:

  $P0 = open "my/file/name.txt"

We can also specify the exact mode that the file handle will be in:

  $P0 = open "my/file/name.txt", "wa"

The mode string at the end should be familiar to C programmers, because they
are mostly the same values:

  r  : read
  w  : write
  wa : append
  p  : pipe

So if we want a handle that we can read and write to, we write the mode string
C<"rw">. If we want to be able to read and write to it, but we don't want
write operations to overwrite the existing contents, we use C<"rwa"> instead.

When we are done with a filehandle that we've created, we can shut it down
with the C<close> op. Notice that we don't want to be closing any of the
standard streams.

  close $P0

With a filehandle, we can perform all the same operations as we could earlier,
but we pass the filehandle as an additional argument to tell the op where to
write or read the data from.

  print "hello"       # Write "hello!" to STDOUT

  $P0 = getstdout
  print $P0, "hello"  # Same, but more explicit

  say $P0, " world!"  # say to STDOUT

  $P1 = open "myfile.txt", "wa"
  print $P1, "foo"    # Write "foo" to myfile.txt

=head2 Filehandle PMCs

Let's see a little example of a program that reads in data from a file, and
prints it to STDOUT.

=begin PIR

  .sub 'main'
    $P0 = getstdout
    $P1 = open "myfile.txt", "r"
    loop_top:
      $S0 = readline $P1
      print $P0, $S0
      if $P1 goto loop_top
    close $P1
  .end

=end PIR

This example shows that treating a filehandle PMC like a boolean value
returns whether or not we have reached the end of the file. A true return
value means there is more file to read. A false return value means we are at
the end. In addition to this behavior, Filehandle PMCs have a number of methods
that can be used to perform various operations.

=over 4

=item C<$P0.'open'(STRING filename, STRING mode)>

Opens the filehandle. Takes two optional strings: the name of the file to open
and the open mode. If no filename is given, the previous filename associated
with the filehandle is opened. If no mode is given, the previously-used mode
is used.

  $P0 = new 'Filehandle'
  $P0.'open'("myfile.txt", "r")

  $P0 = open "myfile.txt", "r"   # Same!

The C<open> opcode internally creates a new filehandle PMC and calls the
C<'open'()> method on it. So even though the above two code snippets act in
an identical way, the later one is a little more concise to write. The caveat
is that the C<open> opcode creates a new PMC for every call, while the
C<'open'()> method call can reuse an existing filehandle PMC for a new file.

=item C<$P0.'isatty'()>

Returns a boolean value whether the filehandle is a TTY terminal

=item C<$P0.'close'()>

Closes the filehandle. Can be reopened with C<.'open'> later.

  $P0.'close'()

  close $P0   # Same

The C<close> opcode calls the C<'close'()> method on the Filehandle PMC
internally, so these two calls are equivalent.

=item C<$P0.'is_closed'()>

Returns true if the filehandle is closed, false if it is opened.

=item C<$P0.'read'(INTVAL length)>

Reads C<length> bytes from the filehandle.

  $S0 = read $P0, 10

  $P0.'read'(10)

The two calls are equivalent, and the C<read> opcode calls the C<'read'()>
method internally.

=item C<$P0.'readline'()>

Reads an entire line (up to a newline character or EOF) from the filehandle.

=item C<$P0.'readline_interactive'(STRING prompt)>

Displays the string C<prompt> and then reads a line of input.

=item C<$P0.'readall'(STRING name)>

Reads the entire file C<name> into a string. If the filehandle is closed,
it will open the file given by C<name>, read the entire file, and then close
the handle. If the filehandle is already open, C<name> should not be passed
(it is an optional parameter).

=item C<$P0.'flush'()>

Flushes the buffer

=item C<$P0.'print'(PMC to_print)>

Prints the given value to the filehandle. The C<print> opcode uses the
C<'print'()> method internally.

  print "Hello"

  $P0 = getstdout
  print $P0, "Hello!"    # Same

  $P0.'print'("Hello!")  # Same

=item C<$P0.'puts'(STRING to_print)>

Prints the given string value to the filehandle

=item C<$P0.'buffer_type'(STRING new_type)>

If C<new_type> is given, changes the buffer to the new type. If it is not,
returns the current type. Acceptable types are:

  unbuffered
  line-buffered
  full-buffered

=item C<$P0.'buffer_size'(INTVAL size)>

If C<size> is given, set the size of the buffer. If not, returns the size of
the current buffer.

=item C<$P0.'mode'()>

Returns the current file access mode.

=item C<$P0.'encoding'(STRING encoding)>

Sets the filehandle's string encoding to C<encoding> if given, returns the
current encoding otherwise.

=item C<$P0.'eof'()>

Returns true if the filehandle is at the end of the current file, false
otherwise.

=item C<$P0.'get_fd'()>

Returns the integer file descriptor of the current file, but only on operating
systems that use file descriptors. Returns C<-1> on systems that do not
support this.

=back

=head2 Exceptions

Parrot includes a robust exception mechanism that is not only used internally
to implement a variety of control flow constructs, but is also available for
use directly from PIR code. Exceptions, in as few words as possible, are
error conditions in the program. Exceptions are I<thrown> when an error
occurs, and they can be I<caught> by special routines called I<handlers>. This
enables Parrot to recover from errors in a controlled way, instead of crashing
and terminating the process entirely.

Exceptions, like most other data objects in Parrot, are PMCs. They contain
and provide access to a number of different bits of data about the error,
such as the location where the error was thrown (including complete
backtraces), any annotation information from the file, and other data.

=head3 Throwing Exceptions

Many exceptions are used internally in Parrot to indicate error conditions.
Opcodes such as C<die> and C<warn> throw exceptions internally to do what they
are supposed to do. Other opcodes such as C<div> throw exceptions only when
an error occurs, such as an attempted division by zero.

Exceptions can also be thrown manually using the C<throw> opcode. Here's an
example:

  $P0 = new 'Exception'
  throw $P0

This throws the exception object as an error. If there are any available
handlers in scope, the interpreter will pass the exception object to the
handler and continue execution there. If there are no handlers available,
Parrot will exit.

=head3 Exception Attributes

Since Exceptions are PMC objects, they can contain a number of useful data
items. One such data item is the message:

  $P0 = new 'Exception'
  $P1 = new 'String'
  $P1 = "this is an error message for the exception"
  $P0["message"] = $P1

Another is the severity and the type:

  $P0["severity"] = 1   # An integer value
  $P0["type"] = 2       # Also an Integer

Finally, there is a spot for additional data to be included:

  $P0["payload"] = $P2  # Any arbitrary PMC

=head3 Exception Handlers

Exception handlers are labels in PIR code that can be jumped to when an
exception is thrown. To list a label as an exception handler, the C<push_eh>
opcode is used. All handlers exist on a stack. Pushing a new handler adds it
to the top of the stack, and using the C<pop_eh> opcode pops the handler off
the top of the stack.

  push_eh my_handler
    # something that might cause an error

  my_handler:
    # handle the error here

=head3 Catching Exceptions

The exception PMC that was thrown can be caught using the C<.get_results()>
directive. This returns the Exception PMC object that was thrown from inside
the handler:

  my_handler:
    .local pmc err
    .get_results(err)

With the exception PMC available, the various attributes of that PMC can be
accessed and analyzed for additional information about the error.

=head3 Exception Handler PMCs

Like all other interesting data types in Parrot, exception handlers are a PMC
type. When using the syntax above with C<push_eh LABEL>, the handler PMC
is created internally by Parrot. However, you can create it explicitly too
if you want:

  $P0 = new 'ExceptionHandler'
  set_addr $P0, my_handler
  push_eh $P0
  ...

  my_handler:
    ...

=head3 Rethrowing Exceptions

Exception handlers are nested and are stored in a stack. This is because not
all handlers are intended to handle all exceptions. If a handler cannot deal
with a particular exception, it can C<rethrow> the exception to the next outer handler
handler. If none of the set handlers can handle the exception, the exception is a fatal error and Parrot will exit.

=head2 Annotations

Annotations are pieces of metadata that can be stored in a bytecode file to
give some information about what the original source code looked like. This
is especially important when dealing with high-level languages. We'll go into
detail about annotations and their use in Chapter 10.

Annotations are created using the c<.annotation> keyword. Annotations consist
of a key/value pair, where the key is a string and the value is an integer,
a number, or a string. Since annotations are stored compactly as constants in
the compiled bytecode, PMCs cannot be used.

  .annotation 'file', 'mysource.lang'
  .annotation 'line', 42
  .annotation 'compiletime', 0.3456

Annotations exist, or are "in force" throughout the entire subroutine,
or until they are redefined. Creating a new annotation with the same name as
an old one overwrites it with the new value. The current hash of annotations
can be retrieved with the C<annotations> opcode:

  .annotation 'line', 1
  $P0 = annotations # {'line' => 1}
  .annotation 'line', 2
  $P0 = annotations # {'line' => 2}

Or, to retrieve a single annotation by name, you can write:

  $I0 = annotations 'line'

=head3 Annotations in Exceptions

Exception objects contain information about the annotations that were in force
when the exception was thrown. These can be retrieved with the
C<'annotation'()>  method of the exception PMC object:

  $I0 = $P0.'annotations'('line')  # only the 'line' annotation
  $P1 = $P0.'annotations'()        # hash of all annotations

Exceptions can also give out a backtrace to try and follow where the program
was exactly when the exception was thrown:

  $P1 = $P0.'backtrace'()

The backtrace PMC is an array of hashes. Each element in the array corresponds
to a function in the current call stack. Each hash has two elements:
C<'annotation'> which is the hash of annotations that were in effect at that
point, and C<'sub'> which is the Sub PMC of that function.
