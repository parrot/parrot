embed.pod - Parrot embedding system

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #include "parrot/embed.h"
    
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        Parrot_Interp interp;
        Parrot_PackFile pf;
        char *bcfile="program.pbc";

        argc--; argv++; /* skip the program name */
        
        interp=Parrot_new();
        Parrot_init(interp);

        if(PARROT_JIT_CAPABLE) {
            Parrot_setflags(interp, PARROT_JIT_FLAG, NULL); /* activate JIT */
        }

        pf=Parrot_readbc(interp, bcfile);
        Parrot_loadbc(interp, pf);

        Parrot_runcode(interp, argc, argv); /* argc and argv as seen by the bytecode file */

        Parrot_destroy(interp);
        
        return 0;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parrot's embedding system is designed with one guiding principle in mind: 
encapsulation.  Users of Parrot shouldn't have to know what the insides
of a C<Parrot_Interp> structure look like or how to load a packfile.  They 
should just know a few functions and constants.  The embedding system is
designed to do just that.

=head2 Data Structures

=over 4

=item C<Parrot_Interp>

This typedef represents (a pointer to) an actual Parrot interpreter.

=item C<Parrot_PackFile>

This structure represents (a pointer to) a 'packfile'--a Parrot bytecode file.

=item C<Parrot_Interp_flag>

An interpreter flag.

=item C<Parrot_Interp_flag_val>

The value passed in with an interpreter flag.  Unused at the moment--just pass
in C<NULL>.

=item C<Parrot_Int>

=item C<Parrot_UInt>

=item C<Parrot_Float>

=item C<Parrot_Opcode>

Various Parrot internal types; most are chosen at Configure time.

=back

=head2 Constants

B<Interpreter flags:>

=over 4

=item C<PARROT_DEBUG_FLAG>

This flag turns on debugging mode.  Debugging mode basically means that 
Parrot's core prints out diagnostic messages.  This flag does not take
any parameters.

=item C<PARROT_TRACE_FLAG>

This flag turns on opcode tracing.  Parrot will print out each opcode and
the parameters passed to it as it is called.  This flag does not take any
parameters.

=item C<PARROT_BOUNDS_FLAG>

This flag turns on bounds checking.  Parrot will make sure that all 
addresses returned by an opcode function are within the boundaries of the
bytecode block.  This flag does not take any parameters.

=item C<PARROT_PROFILE_FLAG>

This flag turns on profiling.  Parrot will print out a list of each opcode
called, the number of times it was called, the average time it took to run,
and the total time it took over the life of the program.  This flag does
not take any parameters.

=item C<PARROT_PREDEREF_FLAG>

This flag turns on predereferencing.  Parrot will transform many offsets 
in the opcode stream to absolute pointers.  This flag does not take any 
parameters.

=item C<PARROT_JIT_FLAG>

This flag turns on just-in-time compilation.  Parrot will convert the 
bytecode file into native machine code and run it, usually resulting in 
substantial speedup.  This flag does not take any parameters.

=back

B<Other constants:>

=over 4

=item C<PARROT_VERSION>

This constant contains a string representation of Parrot's version number.

=item C<PARROT_MAJOR_VERSION>

This constant contains the first part of Parrot's version number.

=item C<PARROT_MINOR_VERSION>

This constant contains the second part of Parrot's version number.

=item C<PARROT_PATCH_VERSION>

This constant contains the third part of Parrot's version number.

=item C<PARROT_CONFIG_DATE>

This constant contains the date that Configure was run to generate config.h.

=item C<PARROT_JIT_CAPABLE>

This constant is true if Parrot supports JIT on this platform, false 
otherwise.

=item C<PARROT_ARCHNAME>

This constant contains a string representation of the Parrot JIT's name for
the current architecture.

=item C<PARROT_CPU_ARCH>

This constant contains the name of your processor (as the JIT sees it).

=item C<PARROT_OS_NAME>

This constant contains the name of your operating system (as the JIT sees
it).

=back

=head2 Functions

=over 4

=item C<Parrot_Interp Parrot_new()>

Allocates and returns a new Parrot interpreter.

=item C<void Parrot_init(Parrot_Interp)>

Initializes a Parrot interpreter.

=item C<void Parrot_setflag(Parrot_Interp, Parrot_Interp_flag, Parrot_Interp_flag_val)>

Sets a flag in the Parrot interpreter.

=item C<Parrot_PackFile Parrot_readbc(Parrot_Interp, char *filename)>

Reads in a bytecode file and returns a packfile structure for it.

=item C<void Parrot_loadbc(Parrot_Interp, Parrot_PackFile)>

Loads a packfile into a Parrot interpreter.

=item C<void Parrot_runcode(Parrot_Interp, int argc, char *argv[])>

Runs the bytecode associated with a Parrot interpreter.  C<argc> and C<argv>
are the parameters the bytecode should receive.

=item C<Parrot_destroy(Parrot_Interp)>

Deallocates all memory associated with a Parrot interpreter.

B<XXX> At the moment, it just leaks most of it.
