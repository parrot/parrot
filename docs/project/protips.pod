docs/project/protips.pod - A Collection of Useful Tips for Parrot Hacking

=head1 Description

Parrot is a complex project that can fail in mysterious and spectacular ways
and has a tendency to exhibit surprising performance bottlenecks.  When that
happens, you have the exciting job of figuring out what's wrong and how to fix
it.  This document exists to provide a repository of knowledge and techniques
to make that job easier.

=head2 Debugging Parrot (external tools)

=head3 gdb

gdb should be a familiar tool, but many developers only use a small subset of
its capabilities.  This section covers some of its lesser known features that
may come in handy while debugging Parrot.  Note that this is not intended to be
an exhaustive resource.  If your favorite technique is missing, please add it.  

=head4 Conditional Breakpoints

gdb's breakpoints are great for inspecting the state of a running (or recently
crashed) program, but sometimes the function or line you want to break on will
be entered many times before it becomes interesting.  gdb allows breakpoints to be tied to conditions like so:
  (gdb) br Parrot_FixedPMCArray_elements if _self == 0
  Breakpoint 1 at 0xb7e69830: file ./src/pmc/fixedpmcarray.c, line 163.

=head4 Pretty-Printing

A very nice feature implemented by Nolan Lum as a Google Code-In project is gdb
pretty-printing support for Parrot's STRING and PMC structs.  This makes those
structs much more discoverable.  Instead of seeing this:
  $1 = {flags = 512, vtable = 0x8096388, data = 0x80b64a4, _metadata = 0x0}
when debugging a PMC or STRING, you'll see this:
  <INSERT AWESOME GDB 7.1 OUTPUT HERE>
Note that you'll need gdb 7.1 or later for this to work.

=head2 Debugging Parrot (internal tools)

When it crashes, Parrot make an effort to provide a PIR-level backtrace in
addition the typical C-level backtrace.  This may not be entirely useful
because libparrot gets its debugging information from imcc, but there's
potential for it to help.

=head2 Profiling (external tools)

TODO: valgrind (memgrind, callgrind)

=head2 Profiling (internal tools)

TODO: profiling runcore

=head2 Misc

When hacking on the Configure system, it's helpful to be able to run a single step instead of having to go through the whole process.  tools/dev/reconfigure.pl exists for that purpose:

  perl tools/dev/reconfigure.pl --step=gen::makefile
