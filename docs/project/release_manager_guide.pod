=head1 Release Instructions

To prepare a release:

=over 4

=item 0.

Announce to parrot-porters and #parrot at least a couple days in advance,
asking if there are any showstopping bugs. You might also select a name
for your release (e.g., perhaps select a name from
L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parrots>).

=item 1.

Make sure you're up to date:

 $ svn update

You may want to ask the developer base to stop committing big changes;
it will avoid complications. Or you could create a release branch before
releasing, rather than after. Then you could fold the release-oriented
changes into the trunk once the release is done.

TODO: explain how to do this

=item 2.

Update files with version-specific information:

=over 4

=item a

Increment the version number in the following files:
F<VERSION>, F<parrot.spec>, F<MANIFEST.generated>, F<META.yml>,
F<README>.

Also update the version number, date, and your name in the
following files: F<DEVELOPING>, F<docs/parrothist.pod>,
and F<docs/ROADMAP.pod>

=item b

Update F<ChangeLog>, F<NEWS> with the new version number and any other
changes that have occurred since the last release: Hopefully these files
are being updated as committers work.

=item c

Make sure F<RESPONSIBLE_PARTIES> is still accurate.

=item d

Run C<perl t/harness t/distro/*.t>, and either fix what those tests
complain about, or fix them so they don't complain.

=item e

Update F<PBC_COMPAT>, perhaps by collapsing intra-release entries
into a single entry naming the release.

=item f

Run C<perl tools/dev/pbc_header.pl --upd t/native_pbc/*.pbc>
to update version and fingerprint in the native tests.

=item g

Make sure everything works:

 $ make realclean
 $ perl Configure.pl ...
 $ make -s all world fulltest

=back

=item 3.

 svn commit

=item 4.

Prepare the release tarball.

=over 4

=item a

Delete F<DEVELOPING>, and its corresponding F<MANIFEST> entry.
This file should never appear in a release.

=item b

Make the release tarball:

 $ make release VERSION=a.b.c

where a.b.c is the version number. This will create the tarball named
F<parrot-a.b.c.tar.gz>.

=back

=item 5.

Untar F<parrot-a.b.c.tar.gz> into another area.

=item 6.

Make sure everything works:

 $ perl Configure.pl
 $ make world
 $ make fulltest

=item 7.

Tag the release as "RELEASE_a_b_c", where a.b.c is the version number. If
you're working in trunk, be sure to specify the revision number generated
in step 3, above.

 $ export SVNPARROT=https://svn.perl.org/parrot
 $ svn copy -m"tagged release a.b.c" \
   SVNPARROT/trunk $SVNPARROT/tags/RELEASE_a_b_c

See also L<Appendix 1> below.

=item 8.

Upload to CPAN.

NOTE: you may get a failure message from the CPAN Indexer about
the content of META.yml. Don't worry, the tarball still uploaded okay.
You can fix META.yml after the release. (TODO: clarify what this means)

=item 9.

Compose and send out the announcements -- parrot-porters,
perl6-language, perl6-announce, perl5-porters, use Perl,
PerlMonks, etc. Don't forget to include the next scheduled
release date.

=over 4

=item a

Submit the use Perl announcement story to Slashdot, Newsforge, etc.
Don't forget to set a Reply-To: or Followup-To: header, if your mail
client lets you.

=item b

Modify the topic on #parrot, e.g.:

 /topic #parrot Parrot 0.4.8 Released | http://parrotcode.org/

=item c

Update the next planned release date on the wiki.

=item d

Update the website. The svn repository for the website is at 
L<https://svn.perl.org/perl.org/docs/live/parrotcode>.

Add a release announcement to news/[year]/Parrot-[release].html.
Update C</index.html> (The old mini-announcement may be commented out).
Update C</source.html>. Make sure all urls are updated appropriately.

Test locally in combust before pushing update out.

=back

=item 10.

Close any release-related tickets in RT. If they are not yet resolved,
migrate them to the next milestone release ticket.

=item 11.

You're done! Help yourself to a beer, cola or other celebratory drink.

=back

=head2 ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT

This document was written after a couple of subtly incorrectly assembled
releases--usually when someone forgot to delete F<DEVELOPING>, but at least
once where the F<MANIFEST> check failed. The intent of this file is to
document what must be done to release so that such mistakes don't happen again.

=head1 Appendix 2

Planned releases in 2007.

To make a monthly release schedule possible, we're spreading the burden
of releases across multiple release managers. Each release manager takes
one release in a 6 month rotation. Releases are scheduled for the 3rd
Tuesday of the month.
