=item B<gmtime>(out STR, in INT)

Take the integer, which represents GMT epoch-seconds, and turn it into a
formatted string.

=item B<localtime>(out STR, in INT)

Take the integer, which represents GMT epoch-seconds, and turn it into a
formatted string. The time is adjusted to localtime before formatting.

=item B<decodetime>(out PMC, in INT)

Take the integer, which represents GMT epoch-seconds, and return an Array
PMC which represents the decoded time. The array elements are
(include "tm.pasm" for the constants):

=over 4

=item 0, .TM_SEC

Seconds (0-60)

=item 1, .TM_MIN

Minutes (0-59)

=item 2, .TM_HOUR

Hours (0-23)

=item 3, .TM_MDAY

Day of month (1-31)

=item 4, .TM_MON

Month of year (1-12) (Note, B<actual> month, not month - 1)

=item 5, .TM_YEAR

Year (note, B<actual> year. The year 2004 comes back as 2004, not 104)

=item 6, .TM_WDAY

Day of week. Sunday is day 0

=item 7, .TM_YDAY

Day of year (0-365)

=item 8, .TM_ISDST

Daylight savings/summer time in effect

=back

Timezone name will be GMT and offset will be 0, since the time is taken and
decoded as GMT.

=item B<decodelocaltime>(out PMC, in INT)

Take the passed in  integer, which represents GMT epoch-seconds, and return
an array as in decodetime. The time is first shifted to localtime before
decoding.

=item B<sysinfo>(out INT, in INT)

Return system information. The values it returns depends on what you
ask. They are:

=over 4

=item C<PARROT_INTSIZE> The size of a platform integer

=item C<PARROT_FLOATSIZE> The size of a platform float

=item C<PARROT_POINTERSIZE> The size of a platform pointer (Largest possible data pointer)

=item C<PARROT_INTMAX> The maximum value of a platform integer

=item C<PARROT_INTMIN> The minimum value of a platform integer

=back

=item B<sysinfo>(out STR, in INT)

Return system information. The values it returns depends on what you
ask. They are:

=over 4

=item C<PARROT_OS> The OS name

This is something like "OS X", "MacOS", "Windows", or "VMS".

=item C<PARROT_OS_VERSION> The OS version string

This is the current (hopefully) OS Version. For OSes that have plain
version numbers it will be the version number. For OSes that name
their versions, it will be the version name.

On HP/UX, this may be something like 11.2, while on Windows it may be
"95", "98", "2000", "NT", "ME", or "XP".

=item C<PARROT_OS_VERSION_NUMBER> The OS version number string

On OSes that don't name themselves, this will be the same as what's
returned in the OS version string. On OSes that I<do> name themselves,
this will be a more specific version number. In all cases it is OS
dependent.

=item C<CPU_ARCH> The CPU architecture

The name of the CPU family, such as "VAX", "Alpha", "PPC", or "x86".

=item C<CPU_TYPE> The CPU model

The model name of the current system's CPU. This is something like
"EV68", "Athlon", or "Pentium III".

=back

Note that some of these values may be set at Parrot compile time,
rather than at runtime, if the system has no reliable way to fetch the
data dynamically, or if there is no way the value can change. Also,
the value returned may be somewhat misleading--Parrot running under a
VirtualPC window will report "Windows" as its OS and "x86" as its CPU,
even if it's really running on an OS X system.
