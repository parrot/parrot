# This file shows the history of incompatible changes to
# Parrot that invalidated existing PBC (Parrot Byte Code) files.
#
# The latest version number of the bytecode format in this file
# is used by Parrot to version the bytecode files it writes and
# is able to read. In the future, Parrot should be able to read
# and/or write older bytecode versions too.
#
# Currently known actions that should be entered here
#   (and invalidate PBC are):
#
# - deleting/changing/inserting existing ops in ops.num
# - changing operands of existing ops
# - adding/deleting/renaming a PMC to classes
# - changes in the packfile format itself
# - changes to any PMCs that are frozen into the .pbc like
#   ParrotInterpreter (HLL_info), Subs and more
# - other core changes that invalidate byte code :)
#
# After changing PBC_COMPAT either disable t/native_pbc tests or
# better, if you have an i386 box at hand, regenerate the PBCs
# with tools/dev/mk_native_pbc and commit the changes

# TODO TT #361: all .pbc files should make-depend on PBC_COMPAT

# Also, if you're removing an opcode, be sure to run "make opsrenumber"

# please insert tab separated entries at the top of the list
